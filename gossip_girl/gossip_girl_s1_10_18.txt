WOMAN: Where has she been?
GOSSIP GIRL: And who am I? That's one secret I'll never 
tell.
You know you love me. XOXO...
...Gossip Girl.
Hey, Upper East Siders, it's that time of year again...
...when the mere act of descending a staircase means 
you're a woman.
That's right, debutante season.
And from what we hear, there's been some changes to 
the lineup.
I'm actually glad I'm going with Prince Theodore instead 
of Nate.
The further we get from the breakup, the more selfinvolved I see he was.
Always so brooding, so tortured. Ugh.
A girl wants Romeo, not Hamlet.
-Romeo died. -Yeah, but he died for something 
exciting.
And I want my debutante ball to be something to die for.
NATE: Hey, so has Blair mentioned who's escorting her?
Why? Are you having remorse-sick fantasies about your 
---------------------------------------
ex?
What? No.
Don't F with an F'er. I know that look.
No. It's just every time I see her, something's different.
She's lighter, she's happier.
She's just less Blair.
She does have a certain glow about her, doesn't she?
I don't understand why you don't get this, okay?
A debutante ball is all a girl could ask for.
It's gorgeous, and formal, and totally legendary.
Don't forget out of touch and totally classist.
If that's how you feel, why are you going?
I'm not going, neither is Serena.
Just gonna meet her grandmother, make a good 
impression...
...and take off before I put my foot in my mouth, like I 
usually do.
All I get with Nate is some rose in the back of a town car.
But with the prince, I get a security detail and a highspeed chase...
...to The Pierre after it's over.
I can see you on the cover of Hello already. Yeah, well, 
try The New York Times.
They've chosen me for "A Night Out With."
I'm gonna give them the most perfect night out of the 
year.
With my dad in rehab, it's like the pressure's finally off 
me.
You know, I can see Blair clearly, and it's....
---------------------------------------
I don't know, man, I think I might miss her.
You don't miss her, man.
BLAIR: Your mom mad you're not being presented?
She doesn't have a leg to stand on since I found out...
...she used to be my boyfriend's father's biggest fan.
-Yeah. -Sounds gross when you say it out loud.
I actually thought you wanted to go.
I'm here with you, aren't I?
Yes, only because your grandmother's meeting you here.
Wah, wah, wah, wah.
SERENA: Oh, you're here. -Hey.
I'm so glad. I can't wait for you to meet my grandma 
CeCe.
-You're just gonna love her. DAN: I'm sure I will.
If you don't listen to me, you're gonna hear from her. I 
promise, you don't want that.
The brands I listed are the key to her happiness...
...and that includes Tanqueray.
-Dan, Jenny, it's so good to see you. -Hi.
-Jenny, what are you doing here? -She loves these 
things, apparently.
Well, I wish Serena did. It would make my life a whole lot 
easier.
My grandma was the chairwoman for this event for 15 
years.
And now the committee's asked my mom to join.
And my daughter could not wait to go for 10 years...
...and then suddenly, she's not even coming.
Jenny? Jenny?
---------------------------------------
Why don't you volunteer?
Well, Blair's lead deb, and we're sort of on the outs.
I'm sure if she wanted my help, she would have asked.
Well, I'm asking.
I mean, of course, we'd have to get your parents' 
permission first.
But we could use more help....
I'm sure it will be fine. I'll see you Saturday.
Oh, actually, it's Sunday.
-Can I call you? -Okay.
Okay.
-There is my magnificent granddaughter. -Grandma.
Oh, hello, Mother.
-Is there a bar in this place? WOMAN: No.
I should've known I had to bring the party myself.
So this must be Daniel.
Dan, actually, Dan Humphrey. Hi.
My granddaughter told me that you were delighted when 
she decided...
...not to make her debut this weekend?
Yeah, go ahead, tell her what you think. Grandma loves 
honesty, it's okay.
Well, cotillions just seem antiquated to me.
You know, remnant of a different age.
Well, do go on.
People spend money to have their daughters... ...dance 
in front of others for attention.
If you ask Serena, I bet she'd do that for you right now, 
free of charge.
---------------------------------------
The cotillion teaches the good graces that women 
should have in their arsenal.
I think Serena's graces are pretty spectacular.
Besides, Grandma, you haven't used your graces in a 
while anyway.
-Isn't she great? -She's....
She's great, she's something.
Dan Humphrey, was it?
Yes, Mother.
Pretty hot on Princess Theodore's arm today.
Oh, is that what I am to you? Just an accessory?
Next to him, yes.
-On me you'd be so much more. -Yes, but I can't be on 
you, remember?
Because you don't want Nate to find out. You don't want 
anyone to.
But you'd have to learn how to behave yourself first.
DOROTA: Miss Blair, Mr. Nate for you.
What are you doing here, Nate?
Well, I....
Look, you know, after rehearsal I just....
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
The ball's something we've talked about doing 
together... ...since we were 10 years old.
And I've given you every reason to hate me.
True. Keep going.
And the prince, he's, you know, he's a great dancer and 
all.
But is there any chance you'd go with me instead?
---------------------------------------
For old times' sake?
Nate, after what you pulled on my birthday...
...the only thing we should be doing together is moving 
on.
Yeah, I know.
I haven't worn this sweater in, like, forever, and I just 
pulled it out today...
...and I found this.
That's my pin.
I sewed it there so you'd always have my heart on your 
sleeve.
I know.
I figured you might need it back or something if....
No, it was a gift.
The prince will understand.
Maybe we should go to the ball together.
-As friends. -Absolutely.
-But only as friends. -Just friends.
Hey, Dad.
RUFUS: Hey, sweetheart.
I sense a favor about to be asked.
It's....
Well, turns out, I got a volunteer position at a charity.
That's great.
-When is it? -Sunday night.
I know it's Mom's opening and it's important, but I can 
do both.
As a family, we support each other.
---------------------------------------
One of us has something important, we all show up for 
it.
Maybe you can volunteer next year.
-Dad-- ALISON: Volunteer for what?
Nothing.
Doesn't matter, because Dad said I can't go.
Hey, I, uh, went thrift-store shopping, and I found great 
stuff.
I got you some black vintage pumps.
They're gonna go perfectly with the dress you're gonna 
wear for the opening.
Mom, the kids I go to school with shop at Saks and 
Bendel's.
I can't be walking around in someone's old shoes.
I know, it's gross.
Oh, that reminds me. I still haven't showed you pictures 
from my summer abroad.
-Oh, yes. -Yes. Be right back.
Well, I know you must not be happy, Mother.
I remember how unhappy you were when I didn't go.
And I imagine you came all this way to change Serena's 
mind.
But she is intractable on this.
That's not the reason I came.
Everything okay?
Lily, my darling, the....
The doctors think they found something.
Something? What something?
Something in my lungs.
---------------------------------------
Oh, no. Mom.
Well, they're running tests, but they said that it might not 
be good.
Look, I didn't want to worry you.
I don't want to be a burden to you--
Oh, no, it's no burden at all.
All I want to do...
...is to see my granddaughter make a debut the way I 
did.
-The way my mother did before me. -Oh, Mother, 
anything for you.
What's going on?
Serena, you're going to the debutante ball.
GOSSIP GIRL: Serena van der Woodsen, looks like your 
invitation just arrived.
With strings attached.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
MAN: Everything all right, Mr. Archibald? -Yes, 
everything's fine.
It's just my date. She's never late, and she likes to have 
final approval.
BLAIR: Sorry, sorry, sorry.
My cappuccino was decaf and I couldn't find my phone.
Took forever to get a cab.
But you live up the street.
I wasn't home.
Everything's taken care of. I'll pick you up at 5 in the car.
I got that Laurent-Perrier you like.
I also thought we'd stop by the Modern afterwards for 
dessert...
---------------------------------------
...because that's your favorite.
Blair.
Oh, we don't have to go anywhere afterwards, it's fine.
NATE: Sorry....
-Who's texting you so much? -Serena.
I gotta go back to my house.
My mom is supposed to throw this tea for Serena's 
grandmother.
She had to jet to Paris, so it's all on me.
-Okay. I'll stop by and help you out. -It's all right, I got 
it. Thanks.
Who are you and what did you do with Blair Waldorf?
Not bad, Archibald.
Almost forgot how handsome you are.
Spotted: Nate Archibald learning...
...you don't know a good thing till it's gone and found 
someone else.
So your mom really didn't mind your coming to our ball 
with me?
No, not at all.
LILY: And your father is okay with you volunteering as 
well?
Excuse me.
Jenny.
Alison.
Oh, didn't expect to see you here.
That's me, unexpected.
Mom, can I talk to you for a minute?
No, sweetie, we'll have plenty of time to talk later.
---------------------------------------
You know what, it is so nice of you to let Jenny come to 
our little event.
You know, cotillions really are instructive.
They teach young girls good social graces--
Well, then, I'm sure she'll learn a lot.
-I'm gonna go. -I'll come with you.
No need. I'll see you later.
Thank you so much for being so understanding.
I would do anything for an ill grandparent.
My mom has her art opening, so we're both doing things 
for our families.
My thing isn't without conditions, believe me.
I had a long talk with my mom. If I'm gonna do this...
...I'm gonna be myself in every way.
Can you promise when you're up there as they auction 
you off...
...that you won't go for anything less than a million 
dollars?
-Did you get that out of your system? -I think I'm good.
-Grandma. -Serena, darling.
This is Carter Baizen, your escort for tomorrow night.
Already know each other?
Used to go to school together, a couple years apart.
Hi, I'm Carter.
This is Daniel Humphrey.
-Dan, actually. -Serena's friend.
SERENA: No, my boyfriend.
Oh, nice to meet you, man.
---------------------------------------
-Nice to meet you. CARTER: I'm sorry, you're not--
-You're not escorting her or--? -No, actually, I'm--
Unavailable. Familial obligation.
-Yeah. BLAIR: There you are.
Are you ready for tea?
-I don't like my ice to get lonely, dear. DOROTA: Of 
course, ma'am.
CECE: Carter, it's such a pleasure to have you back with 
us.
True gentlemen are a rare breed.
So it is true that you're back.
Back? Where were you?
KATI: Where wasn't he?
-Disowned his parents, took off. ISABEL: Everyone was 
talking about it.
Gossip Girl even had a dedicated Carter Baizen map on 
Spotted.
Whoa, a map, huh?
In all honesty, I did go a little out of bounds.
Grateful my parents have given me a second chance.
Carter saw the error of his wayward ways...
...and he rose like a phoenix from the ashes, Serena.
Yes, I see that, Grandma.
I mean, they weren't all errors, but....
LILY: Well, your mother did tell me that you got into a bit 
of a....
A scrape in Dubai.
Oh, I love Dubai. Did you stay at the Burj Al Arab?
No, I stayed on Palm Island.
---------------------------------------
-I think Dubai's overrated. -You know what isn't, 
though?
The Prince's Crown Bombardier.
And I also went pheasant hunting with the sheik while I 
was there.
I kept the tags. I'll return everything tomorrow.
Look, I know that my coming back has been rocky.
But I can't keep being afraid that if I act more like your 
mother...
...and less like your friend that I'm gonna lose you.
-If you were in Hudson, I'd be able to go. -Well, I am 
not there, I am here.
I don't care if that makes you happy or unhappy. I'm still 
your mother.
You can come to my show tomorrow, and then you are 
grounded for a week.
What?
Come on, Mom, that's so unfair.
NATE: I just don't get it. I organized everything the way 
she likes it.
I mean, I even made sure my bow tie matched her dress.
Like the book says, she's not that into you.
Man, I have to find out if she's seeing someone. It's 
killing me.
I mean, you guys are still pretty close, aren't you?
-Yeah. -Could you find out who she's seeing?
-Me? -Yes.
Come on, man, who better?
Who better indeed.
Do you like it here, Mr. Humphrey?
---------------------------------------
Well, it's a little bit like a museum, a little cold.
Though the water pressure is unparalleled.
That's not what I meant. But of course... ...you would 
make a joke. That goes to my point.
Excuse me, did I miss something here?
Oh, yes. The way you feel?
It never goes away.
-It just gets worse. -I'm sorry, I don't quite--
You'll always use your dessert fork for your entree.
You'll always feel underdressed no matter what you 
wear.
And at dinner parties, it will be as if... ...there's a 
language that sounds like English...
...and you think you speak it, but they don't hear you...
...and you don't understand them.
As time passes, you'll feel that people never see you 
when they look at you...
...but wonder merely whether you're Serena's whim...
...or her charity case.
Until the day comes when you realize that girls like 
Serena...
...don't end up with Dan Humphrey.
They end up with the Carters of the world. And people 
like you?
They turn into cocktail-party anecdotes of their foolish 
youth.
So why don't you give it up...
...and spare yourself the pain, hm?
I'm sure Serena will understand.
This just in.
---------------------------------------
We hear there's a cold war brewing... ...between Lonely 
Boy and a certain blue blood.
We never thought we'd say this ourselves.
SERENA: There you are. What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on. I just became your escort to 
the ball.
But our money's on Brooklyn for the win.
MAYBURY: Thanks so much for your time, Miss Waldorf. 
See you and the prince later.
I'm not going with the prince anymore. I'm going with 
Nate Archibald.
Given our history, it was only right. He is a perfect 
gentleman, a perfect date.
Chuck Bass. MAYBURY: Hi, John Maybury, New York 
Times.
I'd just like to say how proud I am of Miss Waldorf...
...and her commitment to Mr. Archibald...
...even though he ruined her 17th birthday and slept--
-Thank you, that was great, right? -Take care.
All right. Have a good one.
-What was that? -I should ask you the same question.
Perfect gentleman? Perfect date?
That was a hit last year. Get with the times, he bores
you.
You almost made a fool of me in front of The New York 
Times.
Which proves my very point. You can't be trusted.
Nate is a gentleman. He would never cause a scene.
Never get your blood going.
Speaking of going, that's what you should do.
---------------------------------------
Carter Baizen is on his way here now.
-What are you doing with Carter Baizen? -He left his 
jacket here yesterday.
And I'd rather you be gone when he got here.
There's been enough scenes for today.
So I see it's true what they say about the apple and the 
tree.
Hello, Celia.
I'd say it's nice to see you, but I know how you hate 
dishonesty.
It appears that your son is taking my granddaughter to 
the ball tonight.
-He is? -I'd rather see that not happen.
No point being presented if it's improperly... ...and your 
Daniel is not a proper companion...
...for a girl like Serena.
He's a temporary distraction.
I need her to focus on her future.
RUFUS: Hers or yours?
I am willing to purchase all the paintings in this gallery...
...in exchange for you convincing your son not to 
accompany Serena.
Before you answer, remember.
A grown man with children is in a very different position 
than a young man.
The money could be useful now.
Not to mention how much this sale would mean... ...to 
your wife's career as an artist.
Your money was no good for me then, and it's still no 
good with me now.
And you can rest assured that like me, my son can't be 
---------------------------------------
bought.
I can assure you, just like her mother, my granddaughter 
can be.
What do you mean?
All those years ago, I told Lily to choose between you 
and her inheritance.
I'd tell you the end of that story, but I think you know it 
by heart.
-Little overdressed for an art show. -Dad, listen.
-I've been meaning to tell you-- -Don't worry about 
your mom.
-You don't mind? -No.
I thought I'd be grounded, just like Jenny was.
Gotta admit, it would be worth it.
I don't mind at all.
Tux looks great, shoes look great.
You look so great, you're gonna make me proud.
Show that Celia Rhodes what us Humphrey men are 
made of.
What's going on here?
You're doing that thing again, acting really weird for no 
reason. It's freaking me out.
Oh, Serena's grandmother just came to see me.
We need to talk.
Have you seen Serena's presentation statement?
Wants to take a year off of school to teach English in 
South Asia?
-This simply won't suffice. -What do you want me to do 
about it?
Well, if Serena's doing this for me, it has to be right.
Besides, it took me years to restore our family name after 
---------------------------------------
your exploits.
Trust me, you don't want to do the same.
-Hello? -Hey, volunteer.
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago.
Oh. Um, didn't your mom tell you I'm not coming?
What? I don't understand.
I thought this was, like, your dream.
Don't you wanna see your brother in a tux? Wait, what?
Your brother, Dan, the guy who thinks dancing...
...is making fists and pumping them into the air?
-Dan's going to the ball? -Yeah.
It was just a last-minute thing.
I'm sure he just forgot to tell you.
Um, I'm on my way.
Hey.
Wow, you look incredible.
Thank you.
-You're early. -Well, yeah, we need to talk.
-What's up? -Your grandmother, where is she?
Yeah, she's in the other room with my mom. Why?
I gotta be honest about something here.
I don't think your grandmother is who you think she is.
-What are you talking about? -She's got the whole freespirit act--
Act?
But I don't think she has your best interests at heart.
-Where are you going with this, Dan? -She came by my 
---------------------------------------
dad's gallery today.
She probably just wanted to see your mom's art.
She tried to buy him off so I wouldn't go.
No. She wouldn't do something like that.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
That woman is the most manipulative person I've ever 
met.
She makes your mother look like Gandhi.
That's my grandmother you're talking about.
-I love her. -I know.
I know and I'm so sorry.
But maybe you love her so much that you can't see what 
she's doing.
I said it. There.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.
Maybe we shouldn't.
I'll just talk to you later.
Let's get Carter on the phone.
Yeah.
NATE: Carter Baizen's dating Blair?
CHUCK: He's got everyone fooled.
Blair thinks he's reformed.
He's obviously just toying with her to get at you.
Yeah, it's working.
We need to wait until we can get him in a public place.
Everyone who thinks he's changed can see the truth.
And we can get him back for everything he's done to 
you.
---------------------------------------
-Everything he's doing with Blair. -When's that gonna 
happen?
Sir.
I have a feeling it may be sooner than you think.
MAN: And one more, ladies.
If you don't pull it together, I'm gonna go Naomi 
Campbell on you.
-Maybe Jenny can help you. -No, I'm fine, thank you.
Ms. Ehrlich needs to know how to pronounce that word 
in your statement.
I assume it's a family name.
Hey, beautiful. What's wrong?
I didn't write this, my mother did.
"Serena hopes to live on the Upper East Side...
...volunteering for the Nature Conservancy and Junior 
League.
-Have two children." -Let me see that.
Make it stop, you sound like me.
-Serena, where's Dan? -He's not coming.
-There you go. -Thanks.
What is he doing here?
Carter's clever. He's using Serena as his cover.
It's not the time yet.
Nate, look, I was hoping to see you.
I wanted to apologize, put the past behind the past.
You don't get to say what goes on here.
I'm on to you.
What are you talking about?
---------------------------------------
EHRLICH: Hello and welcome...
...to the Annual Dispensary Cotillion and Debutante Ball.
Katia Farkas, daughter of Jonathan and Rose Farkas...
...escorted by Richard North...
...hopes to major in neuroscience...
...and will continue her family's legacy as supporters...
...of the New York Public Library and Lincoln Center.
Blair Cornelia Waldorf...
...daughter of Harold and Eleanor Waldorf...
...escorted by Nathaniel Archibald...
...plans to be a member of Yale's class of 2013.
She will continue to summer in South Hampton...
...and volunteer her time to children's charities.
And now I'd like to present Serena Celia van der 
Woodsen...
...daughter of committee member Lilian van der 
Woodsen...
...granddaughter of chairwoman emeritus, Celia 
Katherine Rhodes...
...escorted by Carter Baizen.
Miss van der Woodsen hopes to bed as many billionaires 
as she can...
...before settling down to....
Oh, my God.
Sorry.
Miss Isabel Coates, presented by Raymond North...
...daughter of Arthur and Iris Coates.
WOMAN: Here you go. -Thanks.
---------------------------------------
You're back. What happened?
CeCe won.
She has a habit of doing that.
Well, maybe it's for the best. You're here with your 
family.
Hey, where's Jenny? Have you seen her?
Actually, no.
She's probably upset with me for grounding her... ...and 
is trying to teach me a lesson.
I don't know, maybe let her be 10 minutes late before 
you get mad.
Mom, this looks great, all of this. It's beautiful.
Thank you.
-Come on, tour. Let's go. -Okay.
What's going on?
Huh? Nothing.
We're friends now, right? You can tell me.
And now for someone with only one left foot.
He just told her what he's going to do to her later.
They might not know who you are, but I sure as hell 
haven't forgotten.
-Nate, what are you doing? NATE: She's my girlfriend.
Oh, my God. Lily.
CARTER: Get off me, man.
-They ripped my dress. -Take them outside.
-Get out of here. -You don't understand...
-...it was custom-made. -Jenny. Hey, we need you, 
please.
I have to go. I have my mom's thing.
---------------------------------------
Jenny, fix my dress and all is forgiven.
You make a fool of the presenter, then you start a brawl.
What's next, Serena, Girls Gone Wild?
Serena van der Woodsen wants to work for the Junior 
League, have two children?
It's a society ball, sweetie. You have to represent 
yourself well.
How is it representing myself well if it's all lies?
What happened to you between our talk and now?
I did this because I knew how important it was for you 
and Grandma...
...and you said that if I did it, I could be myself.
-You don't really want that, do you? -No, it's not entirely 
true.
All you care about when people look at me is what they 
think of you.
How am I supposed to accept myself if my own mother 
doesn't accept me?
Oh, honey, of course I accept you.
No.
No, you don't. But let me tell you something.
If I ever do have those two children, I would never do 
this to them.
I would accept them for who they are, including who they 
date, no matter what.
And I'd make sure they damn well knew it.
Hello?
Really?
Okay.
SERENA: Oh, I'm so sorry.
---------------------------------------
I know this is not what you signed up for.
It's okay.
It doesn't hurt nearly as bad as waking up that morning 
in Santorini...
...and finding you jumped on a boat.
Yeah, well, that night wasn't exactly what I signed up for 
either.
The whole thing caught me a bit by surprise.
No, I get it.
Which is why I was surprised when your grandmother 
called me last week.
Wait, last week?
I wasn't even going to cotillion last week.
Yeah, but CeCe said she thought you'd change your 
mind.
-What are you doing? Shouldn't you be--? -Anywhere 
but here, yes.
So please listen to me and don't interrupt...
...because what I have to say is hard for me.
Okay.
When I was your age, I would've been lucky to find a guy 
like you...
...and I kind of did.
But when it came down to it...
...I thought my mother knew who I was much better than 
I knew myself.
I'm not sure exactly who my daughter was...
...but I know who she's become since she met you.
She returns home every night at a reasonable hour...
...she doesn't drink, she doesn't do drugs.
---------------------------------------
I don't know if you're responsible for that, but I don't 
think it's a coincidence.
You belong with my daughter, and I think everyone 
should know that.
Will you come with me?
-Yes, Mrs. van der Woodsen, I'd love to. -Good.
And it's Lily.
-Have you seen Nate? -Nate was asked to leave, but 
here I am.
BLAIR: I know that look.
That's a look when your plan falls into place.
You're enjoying this.
You knew Carter was going to my house...
...you tipped off Gossip Girl.
You ruined my cotillion on purpose.
You did this for your own enjoyment and didn't care what 
it'd do to me.
Which is why you and I could never work.
Hey, slow down there, Waldorf.
You make me sick.
This thing between us, it's over.
-For good. -Wait, I didn't mean to--
Don't talk to me.
Blair.
That was quite a mess you made.
But I was able to clean it up.
The chair's agreed to reissue your presentation 
statement...
...in the committee's winter newsletter.
---------------------------------------
I stood up for you.
-What are you talking about? -With Dan, I defended you.
We'll talk about that later.
No, we don't need to talk at all, Grandma.
I just wanna know one thing.
Are you even ill?
No.
But I could be. All those cigarettes and cocktails.
Why did you do this?
Oh, Serena...
...there is so much you don't understand.
A woman has to earn the right to create her own rules.
Things aren't the way they were when you were young, 
Grandma.
You may be right about that.
-Hey, have you seen Blair Waldorf? -Up there.
It was so hot how you punched Carter out.
I've never seen you do anything like that before.
Spotted: Chuck Bass, losing something no one knew he 
had to begin with.
His heart.
Mom, I'm sorry.
I thought I could make it in time.
Yeah, I know.
I accept your apology...
...but it doesn't really make it okay.
Sweetie....
---------------------------------------
Honey, as you get older, every choice that you make...
...defines who you're gonna turn into.
So rather than apologizing to me...
...you need to look at yourself and ask if you like the 
person you're becoming.
We're not supposed to talk, remember?
I had to. Your mother came to see me.
She mentioned something about why you left me all 
those years ago.
Yes, well, she made me an offer I couldn't refuse.
And I wasn't strong enough then.
Why didn't you tell me?
Oh, come on, you never would have understood.
But if I had known you hadn't actually left me for him.
-I mean, maybe-- -Listen, don't.
Don't say it. Don't even think it.
I can't help myself.
I never should have let you let me go.
It's often said that no matter the truth, people see what 
they want to see.
Some people might take a step back and find out...
...they were looking at the same big picture all along.
Some people might see that their lies have almost caught 
up to them.
Some people may see what was there all along.
And then there are those other people, the ones who run 
as far as they can...
...so they don't have to look at themselves.
Where to, Mr. Bass?
---------------------------------------
The airport.
And as for me, I can see clearly now.
XOXO, Gossip Girl.

WOMAN: Where has she been?
GOSSIP GIRL: And who am I?
That's one secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me. XOXO...
...Gossip Girl.
GOSSIP GIRL: Hey, Upper East Siders.
It's Christmas in New York...
...and along with the season comes the Constance 
Billard-St. Jude's Bazaar...
...where the only thing bizarre are the donated items for 
sale.
How about an antique butter churn? Gosh, that would go 
so well with my loom.
I know what I'm getting you for Christmas now.
-Oh, for when I move to Siberia? -No.
Come on, New York hardly even gets cold anymore, and 
it never snows.
Who wants chestnuts roasting when it feels like Florida?
Okay, global-warming grinch.
I'm just saying, Christmas should be white and snowy.
I'd even settle for Manhattan slush.
-There you are. -Hey, Vanessa, what are you doing 
here?
---------------------------------------
-Hey. -Merry Christmas.
This is a copy of The New Yorker. Thank you, but I have 
a subscription.
There's something else in there. A letter.
What does it say, Serena?
"Dear Mr. Humphrey:
We're pleased to advise you that we'd like to publish your 
short story...
...in our summer-fiction issue featuring 20 Under 20."
It's a contest for young unknown writers.
-I might have... DAN: Oh, my God.
-...submitted you. -I'm gonna be published?
In The New Yorker. That.... Oh. This can't be real.
-Is this real? -This is so great.
-I haven't even read your stories. -He doesn't show 
them to anyone.
I swiped this one out of his drawer on the pretense of 
borrowing a stapler.
-Slick. You never did return that stapler. -Mm-mm.
Let's see. "Your story is called '10-8-05.'"
What's that date?
Vanessa, thank you.
I don't know how you did this, but this is the best present 
ever.
I can't believe we just took a cab for $32.
I can't believe you were gonna wait an hour for another 
subway.
They said another train was on its way.
-Excuse me. Pardon me. BART: Oh.
---------------------------------------
-Rufus, Alison, hello. -Hi.
Oh, Rufus, uh, you remember my friend Bartholomew 
Bass.
-Hi, from, uh, Eleanor's. -Yeah, hello.
-Eleanor's? -Oh, this is my wife, Alison.
-Hi. -How do you do?
Well, it's lovely to see you both. Excuse us, please.
I guess Lily's targeted her next billionaire.
Actually, I think she's had him in her sights for a while.
Well, that was awkward.
It wouldn't be if you let people know what we're doing.
I'm just starting to trust you again.
The reason you didn't trust me last time was because of 
a misunderstanding.
And to avoid another, understand that if it doesn't work 
out again...
...I'm gonna feel twice as humiliated.
Not telling people about us ensures that we don't work 
out.
Look, when I committed myself to you, I meant it.
You know I am in love with you. What are you waiting 
for?
Blair.
-Oh.... Happy holidays. -Happy holidays, Mrs. van der 
Woodsen.
Mr. Bass, I didn't think you were in town.
-I figured you were with-- -With Charles, no.
Sadly, I'm stuck here on business... ...while he suns 
himself at my hotel in Monaco.
I have my staff keeping an eye on him, and I'll join him 
---------------------------------------
for New Year's.
Oh. Right.
I was wondering why he'd been so quiet, and Monaco 
answers my question.
-Yeah. -Lovely to see you two.
-You too. -Bye.
-Blair, there you are. -I can't talk right now, Serena.
-I'm late and I have-- -A huge sweet tooth?
They're for my dad. We get them every year.
He landed from Paris 27 minutes ago.
Oh, then vite, vite. I'll parle while you marches.
Come on, I said vite.
Hey.
-Nice holiday spirit, scrooge. -Oh, gosh.
So it's gonna be a real Waldorf Christmas? Well, a real 
Waldorf Christmas Eve.
Eleanor drew the line at Christmas day. That's only for 
me, her and Dorota.
-You'll have a couple days with your dad. -More.
I'm gonna convince him to stay in New York. What about 
Paris and Roman?
Roman is a phase. My father belongs here with me.
He only left New York to ride out the scandal.
Time to come home. Hey, did you wanna ask me 
something?
A gift for Dan now that Vanessa got him the most 
thoughtful, Dan-like present ever.
Why don't you just buy him a new outfit for Cedric?
Thank you for being totally not helpful at all.
---------------------------------------
-See you tomorrow night. -Bye.
-Hi. -Blair Bear.
-Oh.... -Look at you.
Mm. More beautiful than ever.
Sweetheart, you remember Roman.
Blair.
You are still perfection.
Delicate, yet full with flavor, like a macaron.
Imagine my surprise when the elevator door opened...
...and out popped both of them.
HAROLD: I didn't think you'd mind.
It's the perfect opportunity for you two to get to know 
each other.
Absolutely. This is for you.
Sweetheart, you remembered. It's, uh, our tradition.
That's for you.
-Merci, Blair. -My pleasure.
-My son, the writer. -Published writer.
You got your dream girl and The New Yorker.
-Maybe you should just die now. -It's true. I may have 
peaked.
This one is from the Smiths. "Season's Greetings." That's 
very original.
Their name's Smith. They don't have to be original.
-This one is from, uh, Alex. -What?
-"Alison, meet me on the 24th--" -No, Dan.
And that's not a Christmas card.
Why is he writing to you...
---------------------------------------
...sending cards to the house, asking to see you?
I don't know.
Guys, we're still here. We can hear you.
Rufus, it's over with Alex, okay?
I'm home now, with my family.
Good.
Let's all rewind and just pretend this never happened.
This is not gonna ruin our Christmas.
-I can't believe you're okay with this. -Who said I am 
okay with this?
What am I supposed to do, make a scene?
Behave like some pathetic scorned wife? No.
Roman does not even know how to ice-skate.
Can't you escort him out of the park on the way to your 
meeting?
Drop him at a nail salon?
I cannot bother myself trying to wrestle Roman away 
from you.
I have to mentally prepare.
I am meeting with the CEO of Victoria's Secret, after all.
-Victoria's Secret? -Yes.
I'm designing a line of retro-chic sleepwear and lingerie.
I'm looking forward to the samples. We're all very proud.
In fact, Mom, why don't you tell Roman all about it?
-I'm sure he'd be fascinated. -Talk about more.
-It's so good to have you here. -It's good to be here.
Where's handsome Nate? Am I gonna see him tonight?
He's in Connecticut with his mom.
---------------------------------------
He said he would try to catch a train and make it to the 
party.
Ah, well, an Eleanor Waldorf soiree. Another New York 
institution that I miss.
You don't have to miss any of it.
Yeah, well, I wish that I could be in two places at once, 
my dear...
...but impossible.
I'm sorry.
You know that chateau near Lyons that I told you about?
-Mm-hm. -Roman and I bought it.
-You bought that place? -Yes.
And with Roman?
The house is flooded with light. The fireplaces are big 
enough.
I mean, you can walk into them. The gardens 
are...incroyables.
Uh, pardon me.
I'm taking my niece skating and I can't seem to locate 
the rink.
Well, it's right over there.
Of course, the throng of children in mittens should have 
tipped me off.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
That handsome man was just flirting with you.
That's absurd. He was not flirting with me.
Roman, it is going to be so dull for you to sit and watch 
them skate.
Yes, why don't you go to the petting zoo and feed the 
sheep?
Or why don't I join you on the rink? It looks fun.
---------------------------------------
-Wonderful. -Yes. Super.
I'll get you skates.
-See you there. -Super.
You're not autographing those and selling them on eBay, 
are you?
No, no, no, I'm just checking out some of the previous 
publishees.
And I'm in great company here.
It's The New Yorker, V. How can I top this?
I can't, unless I can rig the Oscars for one of your 
documentaries.
You got in on your own. Only gift I gave you was to lick 
a stamp.
And as for me...
...the annual Dan Humphrey Christmas CD Mix is more 
than enough.
Oh, right, yeah.
Hey.
-What's in the bag? -Perfection.
Look, I know it's not Christmas yet, but open it.
Please? I can't wait. I'm too excited.
-Oh, my. -Ha-ha-ha.
I noticed you don't wear a watch.
It occurred to me it's because you don't have a watch.
You're gonna need one for meetings with editors and 
publishers...
...now that you're a fancy and apparently self-important 
writer.
-You want the brown band. -No, no, no. I love the band.
I love the whole thing. It's the most amazing watch I've 
---------------------------------------
ever seen.
-But I can't accept this. -What? Oh, yes, you can.
Look, it's more of a gift for me because I had so much 
fun picking it out.
You have to.
Serena, I buy a book for my dad every Christmas.
I think the most elaborate gift I've ever given has been 
rubber boots... ...from L.L.Bean.
So then I overdid it?
I think even your underdoing it would be overdoing it.
Look, um, let's--
Let's set some rules, maybe some helpful guidelines.
Fine.
Deadline?
Um.... Tomorrow morning. Price limit?
-Fifty bucks. -All right. May the best gift win.
-Hey. Um.... -Hey.
If it's any help, I could tell you Dan's favorite used-book 
shop.
That's okay, I think I got it.
-Are you Alex? -Who are you?
Rufus Humphrey.
Unless you wanna be carried out, you're gonna stay 
away from my wife.
Calm down, man.
You sent a letter to my wife, at my house, where my 
children live.
Whatever you had with her is over.
-Why don't you sit down? -She told you to leave her 
---------------------------------------
alone.
I'm sorry.
That's not what she told me a couple days ago.
Excuse me? You've....
You spoke to her?
You can do it. You can do it.
Look at all these children. They're skating around 
fearlessly.
-Come on. -They've got a shorter way to fall.
-Blair, will you help us here? We need you. -Just a 
second.
My laces came undone.
-Ready? Now go to Blair. -Okay.
-You can do it. -Blair.
Come give us a lesson.
Spotted spinning at Wollman Rink, the Blair Capades.
All the grace of Nancy Kerrigan, but packing the punch 
of Tonya Harding.
Are you all right?
I'm so clumsy. My foot got caught behind Blair's skate.
Here, let me help you.
I cannot believe that Daddy decided to stay with 
Roman...
...instead of having tea at The Carlyle with me.
The ER doctor said he would make a full recovery.
Everything is ruined.
How could you say that? You and I had a marvelous time.
I'm sorry, Mother. It's just not the same.
---------------------------------------
I don't understand how that French fox stole my father 
and your husband...
...and always seems to come off like an innocent lamb.
Roman was not always so innocent, you know.
Really? What's his story?
Well, when I first met him, he was going out with this 
model named Freddy.
-And Freddy was a horrible scoundrel. -Roman would 
be into somebody like that?
Into him? He was absolutely infatuated with him.
Freddy had him under some spell.
I was the one who got him to break out and turn his life 
around.
Don't mention Freddy to your father. It is a sore subject.
Okay. What was Freddy's last name?
Hey. Where were you?
I tried to call you, but your phone was off.
I kept your date for you with Alex.
He's actually a pretty cool guy...
...other than the fact that he's in love with my wife.
He told me about your phone call.
He felt that I owed him an explanation... ...and he was 
right.
-And you didn't tell me that because...? -Because there 
was nothing to tell.
I told Alex that I was back with my family... ...and to stop 
calling.
Would you have come back...
...if Jenny hadn't shown up to bring you?
If I hadn't, would Lily be here right now?
---------------------------------------
I guess by turning our backs on other people... ...we 
thought we could fix ourselves.
Maybe other people aren't the problem.
Maybe we changed.
And at what point do we admit that no matter how much 
we want it...
...or how hard we try--?
It's just not working.
I know it's been 10 minutes since I asked, but... ...you 
sure you don't wanna talk about it?
Dad said he didn't wanna ruin Christmas. That's what I'm 
trying to do.
-Okay, in case you change your mind-- -You're here, I 
know.
Okay, how about this? We know it's something Serena 
doesn't have.
A year of cheese for $600? Are these people kidding?
I could buy a cow for that much money and make my 
own cheese.
You said "make my own cheese."
-That's disgusting. -I'm never gonna find this gift for 
Serena.
Your gift needs to be good to make up for the rest of her 
Christmas.
-What do you mean? -Living in a hotel. How homey can 
it be?
It's not exactly festive. Eric told me they don't even allow 
trees.
CHUCK [ON MACHINE]: Leave a message and I might 
listen to it.
Chuck, you are not answering my calls to torture me, I'm 
sure.
But please, for the love of God, do not tell anybody 
about us.
---------------------------------------
Okay? Please? Please.
Hey, you told me to come right away. Is everything all 
right?
-Yeah. -Why aren't you with your dad?
Uh.... I need your login for your agency's site from your 
modeling days.
My modeling days? I did one print ad for Gap when I was 
12.
-Are you holding an open call? -I have one specific look 
in mind.
Okay, well, I don't know if I'll still even be in here, but....
-Well, look at that. -Addresses and phone numbers. 
Perfect.
You know, I called you an hour ago, BTW. You're late.
Um, you're lucky I'm here. It's Christmas Eve and I still 
haven't found a gift for Dan.
All the stores are closing and I'm totally screwed.
Do you have any idea what you can buy for under $50?
A single entree at a mid-price restaurant? Threequarters of a DVD box set?
Maybe a pair of Wolford stockings.
Oh, stockings, yes. Great idea for Dan.
Blair, please, this is serious.
I don't know, buy him a gold money clip from Cartier.
Say it's 49.99. He won't know the difference.
What are you doing, anyway?
I'm booking me a model.
Hey.
I come to you hat in hand, tail between my legs...
...and off my high horse.
---------------------------------------
I spent the entire day searching for the perfect gift for 
Dan.
Now all the stores are closing, Christmas day is 
looming...
...and, um, I need your help.
I could take this opportunity to gloat, but I actually like 
you...
...so let's get down to business.
-What do you have so far? -Um....
I found a first-edition JL Hall book...
...original Italian poster of The 400 Blows, and a 
Montblanc fountain pen.
-All very thoughtful. -And all exceed $50.
Right. Well, Dan's not really that into things.
Which makes shopping for him kind of hopeless.
The only thing he wants for Christmas is snow.
-It's not like I can give him that. -Are you sure?
Welcome, welcome.
I don't know if you've noticed. We're doing things a little 
untraditionally this year.
I don't know if you've heard.
I'm designing a line of lingerie for Victoria's Secret.
I walked into the store and I fell in love with this tree.
Isn't that lipstick clever?
Good. Have some eggnog.
-Hello? RUFUS: Hey, it's me.
Hey.
So, uh, running into each other at the school fair was 
kind of awkward.
---------------------------------------
I suppose so, especially after our last phone call.
-Rufus, we really shouldn't be speaking. -No, I know.
But if there's something you wanna say, you should go 
ahead and say it.
Is there something you want me to say?
Rufus, why are you calling?
Oh. I....
Just wanted to say merry Christmas.
Hope you have a good holiday.
Yes, well...
...I'm, um, flying to Anguilla with Bart tonight...
...so I'm expecting it to be a great holiday.
One for the ages, in fact.
Good night, Rufus. Goodbye.
Anguilla? What is the matter with me?
Bye-bye.
Ha-ha. I don't think so.
Oh, excuse me.
-What are you doing here? -I was hoping to see you 
again.
I thought it good fortune that Roman tracked me down...
...at the skating rink and extended an invitation.
Oh. Well....
Enjoy the party.
How dare you invite a strange man into my home?
Jack came?
Go talk to him. Bring vodka.
---------------------------------------
Roman, you practically picked him up off the street.
And then I Googled him. His name is Jack Roth.
He owns a prominent hedge fund with offices in London 
and Barcelona.
-And he finds you very attractive. -Well, that's no 
excuse.
And I am doing just fine without your romantic help.
-Are you? -Mm-hm.
Eleanor, we've been friends for a long time.
Since before Marc Jacobs went into rehab.
Friends don't steal other friends' husbands.
Is Nate there? Oh, a few hours ago?
A Chuck Bass didn't call for him, did he?
Uh, never mind. Did Nate say where he was going?
No, no, don't disturb Mrs. Archibald.
I'm sure he's on his way here now. All right, thank you.
Dorota's gonna kill you if you get glue on that comforter.
Sorry we've turned your room into an art studio, but the 
clock is ticking.
I'm done.
Oh, my gosh.
Wow, that's amazing.
Thank you so much, Vanessa. This is gonna be 
incredible.
Good, I'm glad I could help.
I think he'll really love it.
Vanessa, I think I'd like to help with this little project.
Would you come and help me find another pair of 
scissors?
---------------------------------------
It's so nice what you're doing for your friend Dan...
...helping his girlfriend make his Christmas present.
Serena is so grateful because she likes to see the best 
in people.
-I like to see the truth. -Yeah? And what's that?
I think you like Dan a little too much.
Just thought I should let you know someone's watching.
Merry Christmas.
I'm taking off. Call me when you're done?
Okay. Where are you going?
-I'm gonna go check on my daddy. -You were gonna 
help.
-I think my work's done here. -Oh, hello.
-Hi. -Goodbye.
When you two are done hiding up here, I'm taking you 
out for dessert.
I can't, Mom, I'm busy.
But this is important for our family. It'll just be us.
Any time you say it'll just be us, it means you're dating 
someone new.
Whoever it is, I don't care. I'll just meet him at the 
wedding.
Fine, fine.
Then I will just tell you who it is...
...because you're gonna see him around from now on.
It's Bart Bass.
-Bart Bass? -Bart Bass?
Mom, you cannot date Bart Bass.
-You said you didn't care who it was. -That was before 
---------------------------------------
I knew who it was.
He only has one facial expression. He scares me.
And he raised Chuck. That scares me.
Oh.... Serena, as usual, you're being overly dramatic.
I'm not marrying Bart. This is very casual.
And regardless, I'm not asking your permission.
You know, when I suggested this plan, I didn't know that 
it would entail a robbery.
Hey, hey, hey, I left a donation, so it was more of a 
rescue than a robbery.
Those abandoned trees were gonna be kindling the day 
after Christmas.
This tree that we have here is gonna be loved and 
admired.
Oh, yeah, you have a real talent for spin, my brother. 
Okay.
I wish I had more of a talent for heavy lifting.
Yeah, well, what you're doing for Serena is really 
romantic.
I wonder what Mom and Dad are getting each other for 
Christmas.
I thought that if I got them under the same roof...
...that things would go back to the way they were.
They haven't, have they?
I think there's a real possibility that they might split up.
If I hadn't brought her back, though...
...we could've just kept pretending that she was just nuts 
and doing her art.
You did the right thing, Jen. Really, you did.
Because whatever happens now... ...at least we're not 
living in a fantasy, you know?
---------------------------------------
A wonderful party, Eleanor.
-So you ice-skate? -Well, occasionally, with my niece.
-But she's much more talented than I am. -Mm.
Well, I haven't skated since ages... ...but I used to love 
it when I was a girl.
You must have been very beautiful out there on the ice.
Excuse me. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas.
Excuse me. Freddy, what on earth are you doing here?
-Roman invited me. -What?
Freddy, what are you doing here?
-He said that you invited him. -What?
Freddy.
Roman, explain this.
-I can't. -It's so true.
How does one explain the indescribable pull to see an 
old lover...
...to feel that jolt of electricity?
So you couldn't last two days in town without contacting 
him?
I can't believe you'd trust appearances and not me.
Harold, dear, I-- Roman did not invite Freddy.
-I think Blair did. -Blair?
Freddy, if you want to be the featured model in my spring 
catalog...
...you'd better tell us the truth.
She might have offered to buy me a cruise.
And renew my gym membership.
---------------------------------------
Ha. Well, you might as well take that cruise...
...because you'll be featured in my catalog when hell 
freezes over.
Now please get out.
-Thanks for the champagne. -Merry Christmas.
GOSSIP GIRL: Looks like Daddy's little girl...
...isn't sugar and spice and everything nice after all.
I wish you would just slow down for a second and let her 
be.
Well, I just can't believe that Blair would do something 
so cruel.
And to Roman, who's only ever been completely kind to 
her.
It isn't Roman Blair's lashing out at, it's you.
She was so looking forward to spending time with you 
alone...
...and then you show up at our doorstep with your 
lover... ...without a word of warning.
How did you expect her to react?
Well, I hoped that once we were together, it would all
work out.
I suppose that was pretty naive.
Blair learned scheming from her mother... ...and 
unrealistic dreaming from her father.
She tries really hard to act all grown up, but don't you be 
fooled.
She's still a little girl who needs her daddy.
JENNY: Okay, stop, stop, stop. Ow.
Okay. What now?
Now you go in there, distract Dexter, the humorless 
concierge...
---------------------------------------
...while I try and sneak this into an elevator.
All right. Um.... Who's gonna turn you into Hercules so 
you can carry this?
-I did not say the plan was foolproof. -Yeah.
Mrs. van der Woods-- Lily. Hi.
-Dan, Jenny. JENNY: Hi.
-Tree. -Yeah. Um....
They don't allow Christmas trees inside, which is why 
we're out here.
Which is why Dan's about to ask you for a favor.
Does it involve distracting Dexter and sneaking into the 
elevator?
-Why? Would that work? -No, never.
He has the eyes of a hawk and he takes his job very 
seriously.
-So I've noticed. -But Bobby at the service entrance....
I think he could be bought.
Come.
I just sent him a text, and Dan's on his way.
Thank you so much.
It's really no problem. Since there are no problems, I 
should go.
-No, no, no, stay, please. -You don't need me.
-We talked about how to turn it all on. -But I just want 
you to see Dan's face.
-I've really gotta get going. -Okay.
-Well, I'll tell him how much you did. -Please don't. It's 
your present.
Just enjoy your night.
[ON MACHINE] Hey, this is Nate. I can't come to the--
---------------------------------------
May I come in?
Our flight leaves in a few hours. I wanted to say goodbye.
Please forgive me, Blair.
I should have told you that I was bringing Roman.
I knew having him here would be hard for you... ...but I 
love you so much and I love Roman...
...and I was hoping that if we were all thrown together...
...that something perfect would happen and that you 
would love him too.
I was gonna convince you to move back to New York.
But you bought a vineyard in France with Roman.
What's next, a commitment ceremony?
Great.
There's no room in your life for me. Sweetheart, there is 
always room for you...
...no matter where I am, no matter who I'm with.
Now, here.
This is part of your Christmas gift.
Your house in France.
It's very nice, Daddy.
I'm sure you and Roman will totally enjoy it.
And so will you, because this is your room.
It's beautiful.
We're having it decorated just for you.
A cat?
A cat named Cat, like in your favorite movie.
It was Roman's idea.
So merry Christmas, sweetheart.
---------------------------------------
We're hoping that you'll spend the whole summer with 
us.
Merry Christmas. Ha-ha.
Do you like it? Do you think it's cheesy?
No.
No, no, it's incredible.
How did you do this?
Well, I had help from my elves.
Your present is waiting for you at home. But I did bring 
a little pre-present for you.
-This is your story. -Yeah, it's the original.
It's right out of the spiral notebook.
I'm kind of scared to read it. What happened on October 
8th, 2005?
Well, I was accidentally invited to a birthday 
party... ...where I met a girl.
She only spoke two sentences to me.
But I've never forgotten her.
Wait, your story's about me?
Are we really gonna do this?
Yeah.
The arts and crafts were impressive, but how did you 
manage the real snow?
I'm well connected. Ha-ha.
This is without question the best Christmas ever.
Ever in the history of Christmas.
I hate to break the spell...
...but we'd better get home before our families wake up.
-Eleanor, you are a marvel. -Oh....
---------------------------------------
Who knew there were men like you wandering around 
Central Park, lost?
-Harold. -Eleanor, good morning.
-And Jack, nice to see you. -Morning.
Yes, wonderful.
HAROLD: The flights were canceled because of the 
weather.
I wanted to tell Blair in person. Don't worry. We have a 
room at The Pierre.
No, that's nonsense. You'll stay with us.
Thank you.
-So call me later? -Oh, yes.
I'll be spending Christmas with my family.
Bye.
-What's going on? -We're back for Christmas.
Well, Roman, you are in for a treat...
...because a Waldorf Christmas is like no other.
Come on, you. Oh....
-Merry Christmas, Dad. You're up early. -And you're 
getting in awfully late.
Oh. Yeah, well, I left you a message.
Saying the tree shenanigans were taking all night.. ...but 
I didn't think you meant literally all night.
Yeah, yeah, the tree. It was a big production.
Luckily, Serena's mom was there to help with the plan.
Lily was there?
I thought you mentioned she was out of the country.
No, no, they're here. They're gonna go see The 
Nutcracker.
JENNY: Do I smell chocolate-chip waffles? RUFUS: With 
---------------------------------------
hot caramel sauce.
-Your father's Christmas specialty. -Dan, pass the 
chocolate chips.
-Good morning. -Morning.
After breakfast and presents... ...I need to go to the 
gallery to take care of some stuff.
-On Christmas morning? -Well, yeah, you know, art 
never sleeps.
But the three of us could hang out together. It'll be great.
We'll drink hot cocoa and watch a movie...
...and then when your dad comes back, we could all go 
for a walk.
GOSSIP GIRL: Hear those silver bells? It's Christmas time 
in the city.
Some families actually do make the Yuletide gay...
...managing to leave their troubles far away.
Oh, it's beautiful. Thank you, thank you.
You look like a brunette Catherine Deneuve.
BLAIR: It's so gorgeous.
-Merry Christmas, Dorota. So we can text. -Oh....
-Do you like it? -Thank you, Miss Blair.
Other families have a merry little Christmas... ...even 
when their troubles aren't so far away.
So, what did Dad have to do at the gallery, exactly?
Paperwork, I think.
You're going back to Hudson, aren't you?
Yeah.
But, hey, we are gonna be okay.
Come here.
---------------------------------------
We know.
It's all right.
Some presents might end up getting returned.
-I know how you like Florida. -Yeah. Wow. Uh....
Number-one fan.
I'm sorry I didn't get anything for you, Mr. Bass...
...but, uh, I didn't know you'd be coming for Christmas.
Ah, no worries, Eric. And please, call me Bart.
But some gifts are for keeps.
-For you. -Thank you.
Eric, Serena...
...I just want you to know that I have deep feelings for 
your mother.
Mom, your phone.
Uh, Lily, you're not gonna wanna interrupt this moment.
Other presents come when you least expect them.
Hey, Lil.
You know everything is closed on Christmas?
Diners that claim to be open 24/7.
It's false advertising.
And everyone knows the biggest present comes in the 
smallest box.
So, uh, Alison's leaving. She's spending time alone with 
the kids.
And I seemed to have walked all the way from Brooklyn 
to your doorstep...
...without a jacket, in the snow.
So, what the hell.
---------------------------------------
I miss you.
And I have been missing you for a while.
Lily...
...would you do me the honor of being my wife?
-Cheese. -Ah. Perfect.
Then there are those boxes you wish you had never 
opened.
Have a holly jolly Christmas.
XOXO, Gossip Girl.

WOMAN: Where has she been?
GOSSIP GIRL: And who am I?
That's not a secret I'll ever tell.
You know you love me. XOXO...
...Gossip Girl.
GOSSIP GIRL: On the Upper East Side... ...it's easy to 
think that the world is exactly as it appears.
Refined, elegant, imposing.
But sometimes, all it takes is a little key to open the door 
to the wild side.
-Nate. -Why have you been avoiding me?
Avoiding you? What?
Ever since I got back from Monaco, you haven't returned 
my calls or my texts.
-I've barely seen you. -Really?
I don't recall.
Well, do you recall that night after the debutante ball?
Yes, I do.
Blair?
-What are you doing? -This.
Heh. Good catching up.
Enough with the blackmail. Aren't you bored already?
---------------------------------------
I can't avoid Nate forever.
Excuse me.
I didn't say forever.
Just until the sight of you together doesn't turn my 
stomach.
-And when will that be? -Only time will tell.
So unless you want dear Nathaniel to know...
...how you lost your virginity to me in the back of a 
moving vehicle...
...I encourage patience and restraint.
Isn't there someone else you can torture?
Probably, but I choose you.
Why don't I turn that, uh, one-piece into a no-piece?
Find a floaty to talk to, Chuck.
You know, if my dad and your mom...
...come back from South Africa tomorrow engaged...
...we'll be brother and sister.
And you know what they say, the family that plays 
together stays together.
Ah, incest, the universal taboo.
One of the, um, only ones you haven't violated.
Well, I'm game if you are.
Dan Humphrey, age 17...
...enjoying an exotic meal of Cheerios on an exciting 
Saturday night in.
Come on, be interesting. You don't want me to move 
back to Vermont, do you?
No, but if your whole future depends...
...on getting this grant for your documentary...
---------------------------------------
...I really, really think you should find a new subject.
Absolutely not.
The outsider goes inside.
A likable Everyman's pursuit of his dream girl...
...begins his descent into the bowels of hell.
This is mythic stuff.
Okay, not big on the soundtrack.
Whatever movie he's scoring sounds depressing.
Yeah, I think it's a biopic. Try listening to that for three 
weeks straight.
But before Christmas, my dad hadn't finished a song in 
years.
-I don't have the heart to ask him to stop. -Well, I do.
DAN: Hey, Serena.
Yes. Finally some action.
Hey. What are you up to, besides missing me?
Oh, uh, just wondering if you're missing me. VANESSA: 
Aw....
Well, of course I am. At this party that would be a lot 
more fun if you were here.
Party? I thought it was a quiet night with Blair.
Your last night before your mom comes home.
We were, and then Kati and Is showed up. And we all 
went out.
And we ran into some people and then ended up here.
Where's here?
SERENA: 719 East 82nd Street.
Wait a second, that's, um-- That's school, is it not?
Bring your bathing suit.
---------------------------------------
You're swimming? No, you hung up.
So, what will it be, Dan? Cheerios and Chaucer...
...or an illegal party at your prep-school pool...
...with your high-society girlfriend and her nasty 
cohorts?
-Dad? Vanessa and I are going out. RUFUS: All right.
Heh. Well, if you wanna get the perfect shot of me feeling 
like an outsider...
...I'm ready for my close-up.
SERENA: Dan! Aah!
-Hey. -Hey.
Vanessa, hey. Come on, guys.
Hey, get off me.
GIRL 1: Hey! GIRL 2: We need help!
NATE: Help!
DAN: All right, someone call an ambulance. Call an 
ambulance.
Someone call 911.
Hi, we-- We need an ambulance.
Yeah. A kid, he hit his head and he fell in the pool.
It's 719, uh, East 82nd Street.
PRESCOTT: Thanks to the cell phone somebody left 
behind...
...we've got plenty of evidence of who was at the party.
Lucky for you, Andrew Collins is going to be fine.
Unlucky for you, we need to hold someone responsible.
Ms. Queller?
Hello.
---------------------------------------
I'm Ms. Queller, the new headmistress at Constance.
It's unfortunate that we meet under these circumstances.
But I look forward to getting to know each and every one 
of you.
I've already talked to your parents, at least those I could 
reach...
...and look forward to reading your personal essays.
10,000 words describing how you came to be on school 
property after hours...
...using alcohol and drugs...
...where a fellow student almost died.
In other words, what the hell is wrong with you?
I'll also be conducting one-on-one interviews...
...until I discover who broke into the pool and initiated 
the party.
That person will be expelled.
If that person is not identified...
...then you'll all face expulsion.
BLAIR: So we all know how this works. -If no one talks, 
no one gets into trouble.
Who did break in anyway?
We don't have to worry about Nate cracking under 
pressure.
So are we all agreed?
Agreed.
I know you have your sights set on Yale, but this Skull 
and Bones stuff...
-...is a bit much, don't you think? -Maybe.
But it works.
Every time.
---------------------------------------
You know, when someone says "every time"...
...it sounds like more than a few times.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Were you just in the same assembly as me?
Do you think she's gonna expel two-thirds of the junior 
class?
Look, I got you into this.
I'm gonna get you out of it, okay?
Trust me.
GOSSIP GIRL: There's a weak link in every chain.
And it's just a matter of time before this one snaps.
I'm innocent.
Well, except for a crime of passion.
I did something stupid with someone.
Even worse than that, I did the same stupid thing with 
someone else...
...and pretended I had never done that before.
You look confused. Should I walk you through it?
Let's stay on point.
I reviewed your record. It's pristine.
If Constance has a shining star, it's Blair Waldorf.
-I would never expect this from you. -I know.
-I'm the perfect one. -Ms. Waldorf...
...who broke into the pool?
As you said, my unfortunate participation in said party 
was entirely out of character.
I don't know anything about it.
You're taking that paper seriously.
---------------------------------------
This isn't a paper. It's-- It's a heartfelt letter to Blair.
A heartfelt letter? Who spayed you, man?
Blair doesn't even want you.
She's been crystal about that since we got back.
Didn't seem that way when she kissed me.
-She kissed you? -Well, I kissed her, but yup.
What was she like? Into it, or was she more like--?
Of course she was into it.
Yeah, I know, but, uh, heh, you know Blair.
Yes, I do.
I just think she wants me to suffer a little more, even the 
playing field.
-And it's worth it. Believe me. -Huh.
Hey, Dad. Listen, uh, I got your 1001 messages.
-Haven't had the chance to call you. -That's not gonna 
work.
-Guess you heard from the headmistress. -Look, I know 
how upset you were.
Some of the kids who were at the party didn't even tell 
their parents.
You don't have to say anything. I regret leaving the 
house.
But if you know something that could keep you out of 
trouble, then cooperate.
I don't. Really, Dad, I don't.
Don't think these other kids aren't gonna be looking out 
for themselves.
You need to do the same. All right?
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
I got a message that our kids are in trouble at school.
---------------------------------------
And you came all the way to Brooklyn?
No, no, not about that.
Uh, Bart and I just landed at the airport back from our 
trip...
...and he proposed.
And I'm going to say yes.
I wanted you to hear it from me first.
Not from my daughter or your son.
Right. The people who actually talk to me.
If you're referring to the message on Christmas...
...I didn't get it until we were on the plane.
It was very endearing, though.
But not enough to turn the G5 around?
You miss me, that's great. I miss you too.
What? You kissed me at Eleanor's party...
...and then you say you can't see me because your wife 
came home.
And then you call and say you should've never let me go.
And then you're back with Alison again.
-I didn't plan any of that. -That's just it with you.
You don't plan anything.
I'm sure that your current plan will be full of private jets 
and five-star hotels.
Take care, Rufus.
-You have to show this to me? -Trust me.
You're gonna wanna see this before you enter Blair 
Waldorf's evil lair.
It's a homework group.
---------------------------------------
-We're just gonna be writing papers. -Here.
I wasn't sure what it was until I saw it on the computer-
-
That's Chuck.
What is he holding there?
VANESSA: It's a key.
GOSSIP GIRL: Spotted: Lonely Boy learning... ...that 
when the punishment fits the crime...
...there's no reason you can't serve your sentence in 
style.
-Yay. Heh-heh. You're here. -I thought we were gonna 
work.
We are. One night at Bilboquet...
...Kati and Is made out with a guy in Cornell's ethics 
program.
They're getting tips now.
I thought I told you you couldn't film me.
Come here.
You are so naive.
Michael Moore there is obviously using this film to get 
close to Dan.
No, she needs that grant money.
So did you bring your legal pad?
-Wait here, I'll find a quiet place to work. -Okay.
I can't believe you brought that here.
It's evidence. Give it to me.
Chuck, you need to tell the truth.
Whatever happened to "don't speak until spoken to"?
I just saw you with that key. I know you had it at the party.
---------------------------------------
Poor little Humphrey Dumpty.
Look, let me clarify something for you.
Regardless of who you're sleeping with, you and I come 
from different worlds.
In my world, if I'm suspended or expelled...
...a wing is donated in the Bass name.
That sounds like quite a world.
It's not perfect, but one thing it does offer in spades is 
security.
My family can take care of me.
What do the Humphreys have to offer?
Used MetroCards? Your dad's Cassingle?
And in case you were wondering, you narc...
...I only took the key from the party to hide it...
...so we didn't all get blamed.
Including you.
NATE: Blair.
Nate. What are you doing here?
I, uh, wanted to talk to you.
I brought you this.
It's a love letter.
A hostess can't hide in her room. It's unladylike.
Where are you going? I made us a study area.
I'm gonna write my paper at home. I think Chuck is right.
-Wait-- Chuck? No, don't listen to him. -No, the guy 
has a point, actually.
None of you guys take this seriously, because for you, 
it's not.
---------------------------------------
No, it is. Just trust me, okay?
-Please, some space. I'm sorry. VANESSA: Sorry.
Look, I'm all for loyalty and I'm all for sticking together...
...but we are not in the same boat here. I'm on a partial 
scholarship.
My parents have no way of buying my way back into this 
school or any other.
I know this isn't going to be popular with your band of 
brothers...
...but if the person who brought that key refuses to step 
up...
...then anybody who knows anything has the right to say 
something.
Do you--? Do you know who it is?
You do, don't you? And you're not gonna say anything.
Dan, please. You don't understand.
You're right. I mean, I don't understand.
Hey. Let go of me, Bass.
-Drop your Archibald habit first. -You know I already 
have.
Really? A kiss does sort of send the wrong signal.
Let's not waste time denying.
You know what? I'm tired of this. Go ahead and tell him.
You want me to tell him how you slept with me and faked 
your virginity for him?
I'll just tell him you're lying. And who do you think he'll 
believe?
You, who bangs anything in his field of vision...
...or his pure and honest girlfriend of many years?
-Oh, no, he'll believe me. -Why?
---------------------------------------
I have proof.
Good eye, Docu-Girl. I'll take the tape now.
You knew she was watching? This is my house.
-That tape belongs to me. -This is my footage.
And thanks to both of you...
-...I got a new angle on my subject. -Let's get out of 
here.
-You think I'll let you walk out. -Let go of me.
Hey.
I still owe you a black eye...
...so unless this is you coming to claim it, stay away from 
her.
GOSSIP GIRL: Now that sex and lies have been caught 
on videotape...
...V's documentary just became the most anticipated 
new release of the year.
-What are you doing here? -I'm not leaving a message 
for you.
I'm the courier this time.
Well, I can see that, but five minutes ago, my kids--
Why did you come to see me yesterday?
-I told you, out of respect for-- -Respect or regret?
You wanted a reason not to spend...
-...the rest of your life with Bart Bass. -Rufus.
I'm still in love with you.
So, what exactly are you offering, Rufus?
Some retrospective of the way we were over a decade 
ago?
-We're not 20 and on the road-- -Thank God we're 
not...
---------------------------------------
...because your mother made this decision for you back 
then, remember?
Yes.
Look.
I don't know exactly...
...what it would even mean for us to be together.
But can you look at me and tell me you're not the least 
bit curious?
You're at the same crossroads you were years ago.
Claim your life this time.
Live it the way you wanna live it.
I did it. I broke into the school.
After all your family has been through this year...
...I'm surprised to learn that you're behind this.
I know, I know.
And I apologize.
From what I can see, you always seem to be toeing the 
line of mediocrity.
Your grades are average at best.
Almost as though you're not committed to school or your 
future.
Can we just move on to the punishment part of this 
meeting, please?
Certainly.
But I'm curious.
Can you please describe how you broke into the school?
I can do better. I can show you.
And how did you get access to this key?
You're not on the swim team. Not a janitor, right?
---------------------------------------
No.
Where's the key chain?
-The key chain? -Do you remember its color?
Size? What it's made of?
Anything at all?
Who are you trying to protect?
BLAIR: May I have a word?
Off-camera.
Uh, sure. But I think I know what you're gonna say.
I can save you the indignity of groveling by telling you 
right now...
-...no way are you gonna get that tape. -I wasn't going 
to grovel.
That you went there makes it clear you have no idea who 
you're dealing with.
What are you gonna do to me?
Blackball me from eating yogurt on the Met steps? You 
have nothing I need.
You put that footage in your film, I won't sign a release.
I'm not looking for a distribution deal.
Just a local arts grant so I can pay my rent.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
...you're in my shot.
What's that, your stripper money?
Ten thousand dollars for the tape.
-You think I'd take your money? -Yes, I do.
I know girls like you.
You act like money's not important, but money's 
important to everyone.
---------------------------------------
And I thought Blair was manipulative.
Blair's an amateur. She thinks you're just like her.
To Blair, this money is a couple of pairs of Manolos and 
a Chanel bag.
But I know that this much cash can make a real 
difference in your life.
-You're sick. -You're welcome.
GOSSIP GIRL: Who knew B and C were such patrons of 
the arts?
Call it philanthropy or bribery...
...it looks like everyone has their price.
-Something on your mind, Lily? -Uh--
Yeah? What are you saying?
I'm sorry, it's Sheldon. He has those numbers I was 
asking for.
-Do you mind? -No.
Yeah. Just make sure he gets it at the current rate.
The dollar has been all over the place.
-Hello? -I was thinking about what you said.
Let's do it. Let's see what we are.
Let's see what we could be.
Who is this?
Rufus.
Lily, this is great. Do you know how great this is?
Well, yes. I mean, I do. I mean, I think so.
Let's go away tonight, get away from everyone, just 
figure it out.
But where would we go?
Who cares?
---------------------------------------
Okay. Sounds like a plan.
Um, 98th and 5th, 6:00?
Okay.
I'm scared, Rufus.
In a good way.
Me too.
QUELLER: Settle down, please.
-Yesterday, I talked about... -Proof. Worth every penny.
...serious consequences for your action, and obviously, 
you didn't believe me.
But someone came forward today and claimed 
responsibility.
Do you know who?
For a crime he did not commit.
And although I appreciate his self-sacrifice...
...I don't abide dishonesty.
And I think it's time you all know how serious I am.
Nathaniel Archibald is suspended from St. Jude's.
And yes, this will go on his transcript.
Effective immediately.
Mr. Archibald, you know where to find the exit.
GOSSIP GIRL: This just in: Nate Archibald, dead man 
walking.
We hear St. Jude's has a new policy: An eye for a lie.
Watch him go, students.
Who wants to be next?
Until one of you comes forward, we'll keep going...
...until every last one of you has walked out that door.
---------------------------------------
-I don't believe this. -Dan, it's okay.
Serena, I can't get expelled. I cannot get suspended.
My whole future is riding on this.
If you know who broke in, why won't you give them up?
Because it was me.
-So why didn't you tell me right away? -Because I didn't 
want you to judge me.
Aren't we already beyond that?
And I didn't want you to know...
...because I didn't want you to be in the position...
...of having to choose between protecting me and 
helping yourself.
-So how'd you even get in? -I have a key.
You have a key to the pool?
All right, what happened to being beyond this?
Sorry.
The end of freshman year, I kind of dated the swim team 
captain...
...and he gave me a key so that we could, you know, 
meet up and--
Enough said. And Saturday night, what happened then?
Well, Blair and I ran out of places to go.
And she knew I still had a key.
And before I knew it, it's like we were all there.
I thought it was just gonna be us girls.
Then everybody got on their phone and more people 
started showing up and....
Ah.... I just never thought anybody was gonna get hurt.
Yeah. You can still tell Queller the truth. I think she'll 
---------------------------------------
respect your honesty.
-Yeah, like she respected Nate's? -No, Nate lied.
And besides, you're Serena van der Woodsen.
You didn't know me before I went away.
I barely got back into Constance.
If I got expelled, I don't think any school in town would 
take me.
I'm sure that's not true.
I can't risk going back to boarding school.
Being away from you and Eric.
But I don't want you to lose your future.
Oh, wow. You really can be... ...damned if you do and 
screwed if you don't.
WOMAN [OVER PA]: Dan Humphrey... ...Headmistress 
Queller is requesting to see you...
...in her office after class.
BLAIR: Nate.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'll be fine. It's, uh....
My parents have so much other stuff going on right 
now...
...they'll get over it.
-Either way, it was worth it. -Worth it?
Yes. I know how much your future means to you.
You've worked so hard for Yale--
What are you talking about?
You don't have to lie. I saw the key in your bedroom.
Ugh. That key isn't mine.
---------------------------------------
I was just hiding it for someone else.
Wait. That's why you were suspended?
You told the headmistress it was yours because you 
thought it was mine?
That's the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for 
me.
I love you.
BLAIR: Please.
You and I just can't happen right now.
Look, why not?
I don't wanna be with you.
NATE: Good catching up.
-You're home early. -Oh....
LILY: Don't tell me you're expelled. SERENA: Not yet.
Your position at that school is already too precarious.
One false move, and you know what, I can't do anything 
to help you.
SERENA: I know, I know.
I just wanna hide under the covers and make it all go 
away.
And apparently, you do too.
You just got back. Why are you packing again?
Well, I was just gonna go for, you know, a little spa trip 
for the weekend.
Because you're so stressed out from your vacation?
-Aren't you gonna answer that? -No, I don't think so.
Mom, is Dan's dad the reason you haven't answered 
Bart's proposal?
You can't.
---------------------------------------
Please, Mom, not this one.
Look, I will not base my personal life on your 
preferences.
Dan is my boyfriend.
I know we're too young to talk about forever, but that's 
what it feels like.
I know it does, sweetie, but--
But what?
Tell me that Rufus is that important to you.
Tell me that whatever the two of you have is the most 
important thing.
Because that's what Dan is to me, Mom.
The most important.
I would rather be Chuck's stepsister than Dan's.
Please don't do this to me.
Dan means that much to you?
Yeah, he does.
In fact, I have to go.
Wait, where?
School. There's something I have to do.
And I hope there's something you have to do too.
What are you doing here?
I brought this for you.
What's the catch?
I know this might come as a shock, but not everyone 
operates from an agenda.
In fact, some people do things simply because it's the 
decent thing to do.
Smash it, burn it, whatever. There are no copies.
---------------------------------------
-What about the one you gave to Chuck? -It's blank.
Which I'm sure he'll be thrilled to discover.
And about what's on that tape...
...having observed you in your natural habitat these past 
few days...
...Nate seems like one of the good guys, and you seem 
to really care about him.
QUELLER: Mr. Humphrey, you have a partial scholarship 
at St. Jude's.
You are number two in your class...
...have a stellar recommendation for Dartmouth from JL 
Hall.
It looks as if your dreams are well within your grasp.
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I guess they are.
But it seems you're in with a new crowd this year.
Dating Serena van der Woodsen.
Is that on my file?
Who had the key to the school?
I don't know.
Let me remind you one last time that you are in a different 
position than the others.
You need this school.
Headmistress Queller, I have something to tell you.
I must say, your file reads more like a rap sheet.
You cut more sophomore classes than you attended, 
cheated on tests...
...talked back to teachers.
Look, I understand that this is a serious matter.
That's why it's important to me that you know, you being 
new here...
---------------------------------------
...that the person that you just described is not who I am 
anymore.
Oh, no?
Who are you now?
Well, my grades are up...
...my attendance is nearly perfect, and I've stayed out of 
trouble.
Until now.
SERENA: Please understand.
I never intended for anything bad to happen.
And it may have taken some time, but I am here now...
...accepting responsibility for my actions.
Whatever you think is fair.
Yes. Let's discuss the consequences.
BLAIR: I'll be brief.
-And I'll be not interested. -Is that how you speak to the 
person...
-...who paid your rent? -What did you say?
Congratulations, Vanessa.
You just won 365 more days in your IKEA-furnished 
closet.
You went to my building? You talked to my landlord?
No, I don't speak Ukrainian, but I do speak envelope of 
cash.
-He understood me perfectly. -I can't believe you.
Blair Waldorf is not indebted to anyone.
No matter how much I appreciate what you did.
You're welcome, I guess.
Good. Now this transaction is finished.
---------------------------------------
And I'm free to return to disliking you.
And I wouldn't have it any other way.
Oh, and one more thing.
If you didn't pay your rent with it, what did you do with 
Chuck's money?
I may have created a medical grant for teens with genital 
herpes.
In his name.
I can't believe she didn't expel me.
Yeah, I know. It's shocking.
Twenty-five hours of community outreach, that's not bad 
at all.
I would've done it anyway, being as I'm on the 
committee.
That had occurred to me, yeah.
Wait, what are you saying?
No, no, I'm not saying anything, believe me.
So you don't buy what she said...
...about me being the poster child for the new honor 
code?
Look, I know for a fact my mom didn't plead my case or 
donate anything, okay?
I didn't say a thing.
Are you really turning this into an upstairs-downstairs 
thing?
No, no, you are. I'm being completely silent.
I'm happy you're not being expelled or leaving.
Are you hungry? We should--
Always. But you still believe that there's a double 
standard.
---------------------------------------
That people like me get special treatment.
CHAUFFEUR: Ms. van der Woodsen.
Your mother sent me to pick you up.
Oh. Great. That was thoughtful.
I think you get no special treatment at all.
Your life is completely uncharmed and average.
It's okay, I'll walk.
No, come on. I was kidding. I was kidding.
You going to Brooklyn?
It's a rare occasion to celebrate the merging of two 
families.
And I couldn't be happier...
...to be here tonight to celebrate Lily's acceptance of my 
proposal.
BART: So to my lovely bride...
...and our growing family.
You packed light.
Please try to understand.
I think I do.
I'm just sorry.
So am I.
Mom looks about as happy as Grandma at last call.
I know. Seems Bart's personality, or lack thereof, is 
contagious.
I don't even know how she breathes with her blouse 
buttoned that high.
How glad are you to see our families merge, sis?
So glad that if you ever call me that again, it'll be the last 
thing you ever say.
---------------------------------------
I love it. Our first brother-sister squabble.
I hope you're going to make yourself available...
...for more missed childhood memories.
Bathing together, for example.
You're probably wondering why I asked you here.
After our last conversation, yeah.
Do you think it's possible for two people...
...who have been through as much as we have...
...to really forgive and forget?
If we really want to, I think we can.
A lot of mistakes have been made.
If you're ready to forgive me...
...then nothing can tear us apart.
I promise.
What you said before?
I love you too.
Always have, always will.
So....
Your new stepbrother told me about your problem at 
school.
Frankly, I wasn't surprised, given your propensity for 
recklessness and adventure.
I'm sorry?
Don't tell your mother, but I made a call.
-You did what? -It was harder than usual.
That new headmistress of yours is a real piece of work.
I had to go over her head.
---------------------------------------
Sorry I couldn't get the charges completely dropped...
...but, um, at least I got you minimal sentence.
GOSSIP GIRL: One thing about being on the inside...
...once you get there, you don't always get to choose 
where you stand.
Or sit.
I was just looking out for my family.
The new van der Woodsen-Bass library should be 
completed for Eric's graduation.
Lily and I are gonna have our hands full with the two of 
you.
Will you excuse me? I need some air.
GOSSIP GIRL: Sometimes you need to step outside, 
clear your head...
...and remind yourself of who you are.
And where you wanna be.
-Hey. -Aren't you supposed to be... ...at your mom's 
engagement thing?
Yeah. I had to get out of there.
It was getting a little hard to breathe, you know?
Those parties can be that way.
So are you, um, packing up your music?
No. I just need to find something new to write about.
And I will.
Hey. You're a little overdressed for this study date I didn't 
know we had.
You were right, about everything.
Wanna talk about it?
Can I just sit here with you for a while?
---------------------------------------
Yeah.
-Chaucer? -Yeah, I got a test on Friday.
Mine's Thursday.
GOSSIP GIRL: And sometimes you have to venture 
outside your world... ...in order to find yourself.
As for me, I'm happy right where I am.
I only wanna be with you.
XOXO, Gossip Girl.

WOMAN: Where has she been?
GOSSIP GIRL: And who am I? That's one secret I'll never 
tell.
You know you love me. XOXO...
...Gossip Girl.
GOSSIP GIRL: What's the difference between gossip and 
scandal?
So glad you asked, UES Forever.
Anyone can commit a minor indiscretion and generate a 
day's worth of buzz.
But in order for gossip to birth a true scandal...
...it requires the right person to be in the wrong place.
Take one "it" girl on a pedestal...
-Which do you recommend? -...add a crowd eager to 
see her fall...
...and give them the means to knock her down.
WOMAN: I can't believe it. -Oh, my God.
Dan!
What, what? Are you okay?
Fine.
Uh, I was just testing my screaming to see its screaming 
efficiency.
-With your permission, I'd like to kill her. RUFUS: What 
---------------------------------------
are you hiding?
Stop, you're invading my privacy.
-This is a loft, you have no privacy. -No, stop.
You guys. Uh....
Dan, you're gonna be really sorry you did that.
Jenny, would you excuse us?
-Is there something you wanna tell me? -Am I that 
obvious?
Yes, actually. That hair color is all wrong for you.
That's funny. This isn't.
Please say something.
Anything would be better than this I-am-sodisappointed-in-you silence.
Since the time you could walk, your mother and I knew 
you're special.
You're very smart. You're very talented.
And we promised each other we'd do anything to give 
you a bright future.
That did not include you becoming a teenage father.
This wasn't a part of my plan, either. Seriously not a part 
of the plan.
But whatever Serena decides to do, I wanna be there 
for--
I-- I have to be there for her.
-I love her. -Dan....
I do.
I do. Whether she's pregnant, whether she's not 
pregnant.
-I love her. -First things first.
You need to talk to her. Maybe it's not even true.
---------------------------------------
-Did you hear what I said? -I heard, hope you heard 
what I said.
MAN: Hey, Mom. -Yes, I'm pregnant and it's yours.
I've been calling every two seconds for the past hour.
I left my cell at home. I had a lot on my mind.
-I know, and I'm sorry-- DAN: No, wait, me first.
I'm sorry you didn't feel you could tell me, no matter what 
you decide...
...I want you to know that I'm here for you, because I 
love you.
I'm not pregnant, so you don't have to say that. You 
don't have to.
Because I get it, you would have done the right thing.
Um, thank you. That's really sweet.
-Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah. SERENA: Yeah.
That's good news, the no-baby part. That's really good 
news.
-Like my-dad-will-throw-a-party news. -Your dad?
Look, can we actually talk later?
I'm late to meet Blair on the steps of the Met.
Oh, yeah. No, go, go, go. It can wait.
-Unlike Blair, who's waiting on the steps. -Exactly.
-Yeah, okay, I'll talk to you later. DAN: All right.
Hi.
-Jenny, hi. -You're late.
I had to drop some books at the library. Sorry.
BLAIR: Would you do me a favor? -Anything.
Move down a couple of steps.
You know, this hazing thing is getting old, don't you 
---------------------------------------
think, B?
First of all, the hazing stops when I say it stops.
And for future reference, only my friends call me B.
You know, I'm actually gonna go.
I have a lot of stuff to do before class.
-Jenny. -Please, she'll be back.
Hey, you.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
-I'm not pregnant. -Oh, cool.
-Congratulations. -Celebratory drinks after school?
Yeah, sure. Blair, can I talk to you?
Of course.
Excuse me.
-You get my text? -Of course, I did, but I--
-You know I told Dan I'm not pregnant? -Yes, and I'm 
so happy for you.
Close call, huh?
-Are we really gonna play that old game? -I've no idea 
what you're talking about.
When something is not part of your plan, you pretend it 
doesn't exist.
You act like you're in this movie about your perfect life.
Then I have to remind you, the only one watching is you.
You admit your period was late.
Yes, I've been stressed. I had that chem test on Friday.
Acting like a bitch because you're not hormonal?
Maybe I am a total bitch, did you ever think about that?
---------------------------------------
SERENA: Just take the test, B. -Stop it.
Just take the test.
You need to know if you and Chuck are gonna have a 
baby.
GOSSIP GIRL: And for a scandal to really blow up?
All it needs is an unexpected turn.
NATE: Would you do me a really big favor?
What is it, sweetie?
I need you to come with me to visit my dad in rehab.
-Please. -Really?
Yeah, it's just, it gets really awkward.
I'm gonna have to go alone and I don't know what to 
say.
He loves you.
You always know how to make him laugh.
Nathaniel Archibald, you've never asked me for anything.
And here you are, officially leaning on me.
This time we're gonna be so much better together.
We already are.
-Well, at least now you know. -Know what?
I wasted half a year trying to be friends with someone 
who will never like me?
Yeah. That's exactly it.
RUFUS: Hey, guys, so...? -Dad.
You're not gonna be a grandfather.
That's cool.
That's really cool.
Yes, yes, yes!
---------------------------------------
Yes! Yes!
And I thought I was relieved. It's not all good news, 
though.
I told her I love her. And she thinks I said that because 
she was pregnant.
Son, that's probably a good thing.
Gives you a minute to step back and enjoy being 17.
You two were moving a bit too fast, anyway.
I'm late for the gallery, but we can talk more later.
I've never seen you give up.
-Will you not start with me? -Can you not be so easy to 
start with?
Why are you taking his advice?
-He's old and alone. -What?
Tell Serena again.
Without the pregnancy scare, in a quiet, no-distractions 
kind of way.
But what do I know about romance, friends, or anything?
No, no, no. Actually, Jen, that's a good idea.
Right. What would you do without me?
Promise me I will find out one day.
SERENA: Hey, B. -What are you doing here?
-In the neighborhood. -Can we talk later?
Despite your efforts to ruin it, I'm having a good day. 
Don't wanna spoil it.
-Guess who asked to visit the Captain? -Don't know, 
Nate?
Yes. Like he finally needs me and isn't afraid--
Look, I understand you're reluctant to burst your bubble, 
but I'm not giving up.
---------------------------------------
I'm sorry if unlike some, I haven't been on the pill since 15.
Okay, I am giving up.
Before you plan your night, don't you think you--?
I'm not pregnant, Serena.
-What's wrong? Something I cooked? -No, no, no, I'm 
sorry.
It's the best spaghetti I've ever tasted.
Thank you. Even if I did have to drag it out of you myself.
JENNY: Hey, guys.
-Hey, Jenny. DAN: Go back to your room, Jenny.
I'm just getting juice.
Excuse me.
Hey, Jen. Could you do me a favor and drink your juice 
at Vanessa's, maybe?
Going back, closing the door...
...putting on my headphones, and ignoring your date.
DAN: Excellent, thank you.
Where were we?
Well, let's try this.
You tell me what's on your mind. Then it can be on our 
minds...
...then our minds can worry about what's on your mind 
together.
I have no idea what you said.
I don't know what I said either, but what I'm saying now 
is "Talk to me."
I never thought I was pregnant.
The test was for Blair.
---------------------------------------
I'm confused. She just got back together with Nate.
So-- Oh, then who?
Chuck.
DAN: Chuck?
And Blair? Blair and Chuck?
Well, why isn't he the one buying the test?
-Because-- -Because he's an ass.
Who doesn't know.
Why not?
I mean, there's no love lost between us, but I gotta 
believe he deserves to know.
He does have this weird influence over her.
I don't know, maybe he could talk her into taking the test.
It's just, I'm so worried about her.
Come here.
This may be the most amazing purchase you'll make in 
your entire existence.
-Your day almost over? -Not quite.
I got a few canvases to wrap and a little more 
paperwork--
I'm trying to get you to ask me out for after-work drinks.
Okay.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize. Uh....
I guess you're not done for the day after all.
But when you are, call me.
Hi, Rufus. Remember me?
RUFUS: Bex, right? Art dealer.
You bought a very special piece for Lily van der 
---------------------------------------
Woodsen.
I'm looking for some things for a couple other clients.
Any new discoveries since the last time?
A few.
There's a beautiful mixed-media piece on this wall over 
here.
As I recall, you had a wife in Hudson.
That still true?
She's still there. I'm still here.
-It made things a little difficult. -Hmm.
Still trying?
-I'm trying to move on. -Mm.
Tomorrow night too soon to start?
I suppose not. Sounds good.
Okay.
-Hi, Chuck. -Please, call me brother.
-I need to talk to you. -About getting knocked up?
I must say, I was a little disappointed you weren't more 
careful.
Chuck, I really need to trust you.
I'm hoping that deep down inside, you're actually a 
decent person...
...and won't make me regret this.
You're here for Blair, aren't you?
Look, I'm not going to tell Nate about us.
-I tortured her, got bored and moved on. -There's no 
moving on yet.
The pregnancy test wasn't for me, it was for Blair.
---------------------------------------
-What? -She won't take it.
-Given that if she's pregnant, you're the-- -No, we used 
a condom.
Well, obviously, it broke.
What is obvious is that your best friend has kept you in 
the dark.
-What are you talking about? -I handle my business.
Apparently, Nate doesn't.
They slept together just after we did. It's him you should 
be asking for help.
DAN: Uh, hey, Dad. -Need to talk to you about 
something.
It's early in the morning for the "teens gone wild" 
contingency plan.
It's not about your relationship with Serena.
Oh, well, then what?
I need to know how you and Jenny would feel if I went 
out for a drink...
...with a woman.
I feel you shouldn't wear that shirt or there will not be a 
second date.
-Really? -Really.
Thanks.
And now I guess I just have to worry about Jenny, then.
-Good morning. -Hi.
Good morning, sunshine.
Dad. Where'd you get that shirt?
What's wrong with this shirt?
Nothing. As long as you don't wear it out.
It's worse. He plans on wearing it on a date.
---------------------------------------
-For drinks, if that's okay. -Whatever, it's awful.
-I guess you have your answer. -Answer to what?
Nothing.
Morning.
Good morning, Miss Serena.
Anybody notice the weather today?
-What? SERENA: Take a look outside, B.
My first response would be that the sky is a clear-blue 
easy.
Dorota, you may be excused now.
I can't believe you didn't tell me about you and Nate.
-What did he say? -Nothing, Chuck did.
When I went to see him because I thought he could talk 
sense into you.
-You had no right to do that. -I was trying to help.
I took a public bullet for you. Let another rumor about 
me run rampant.
-The whole school heard, even Dan. -What's going on?
Ask Blair.
Her version of the story's always better.
Fine.
ELEANOR: You all right?
-Never been better. -Well, Serena has.
-What's wrong? -I don't know.
I can't be responsible for her mood swings.
Were you arguing about the possibility that your 
condition...
...may have returned?
---------------------------------------
No.
-And it hasn't. -I heard you.
The other day, in your bathroom, with the water running.
I'm very stressed.
With you both down my throat, I can hardly think, never 
mind keep food down.
Maybe you need to take a little break.
Visit your father? Lyon is beautiful this time of year.
-Maybe this summer. -Summer?
Sounds great. Finish your breakfast.
I'm not pregnant.
I command myself not to be pregnant.
-Hello? BLAIR: Hey, S. It's B.
Two things:
First, I'm sorry.
About Dan, the Gossip Girl blasts.
-And not telling you about Nate. -Okay.
You were so hard about Chuck, I didn't wanna be judged 
for sleeping with both.
I understand. Apology accepted.
That was fast. If I were you, I'd have made me work for 
it a little bit harder.
Well, I think you've suffered enough.
-And second thing-- -Wait, that's, like, three things.
I took the test. I'm not pregnant.
Oh, my gosh. Are you kidding me?
I am so happy. I would had no idea what to wear to a 
paternity hearing.
---------------------------------------
-Clean slate? -Oh, clean slate.
I'm so happy. See you at school.
BLAIR: Oh, don't stop on my account. -Oh, I have to.
CHUCK: Second-hand smoke's bad for-- -I'm not 
pregnant.
So bye, mistake-so-far-in-my-past- I-can-hardlyremember.
-You cannot be serious. -You can't touch me.
If you were gonna tell Nate, you would've done so in 
Monaco.
But you don't want him to hate you, and you know he 
would.
-Game over. -Game's not over until I say it is.
Then have fun playing with yourself.
Got them.
Are you cold?
It's pretty cold. Here, let me get you this blanket.
This will be better. Keep you warm.
Um, do you want ginger ale? I brought this.
We can have a nice little drink. It might be a little cold, 
actually.
Are you okay? You're doing that thing.
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
It's just....
I don't know.
In the short time we've known each other... ...you've 
become really important to me.
I've been struggling to find a way to tell you, I'm 
struggling now.
-Oh, my lit paper. No, no, no. -Oh....
---------------------------------------
No, no, no.
-Oh, my gosh. MAN: Here you go.
-I love you, thank you. MAN: No problem, all right, take 
care.
DAN: It was a close call.
I'm sorry. That would have completely ruined our picnic.
Yeah.
Okay, what was it you were saying?
Oh, just....
-I should proofread this for you, can I? -Sure.
Yeah, but can we eat first? Because I'm starving.
Yeah, let's eat.
Can you believe this?
ISABEL: Jenny, come look at this.
GOSSIP GIRL: It seems the Virgin Queen isn't as pure as 
she pretended to be.
Who's your daddy, B?
Baby daddy, that is.
Two guys in one week?
Talk about doing the nasty.
Or should I just say, B-ing nasty.
WOMAN 1: Oh, God. Did you see this?
WOMAN 2: No way. She's right about this.
WOMAN 3: Oh, there she is. WOMAN 4: I can't believe it.
WOMAN 5: Who does she think she is? WOMAN 6: Pot 
calling the kettle black?
WOMAN 7: Never thought she's a virgin. WOMAN 8: I can 
already see a bump.
---------------------------------------
WOMAN 9: What a bitch. WOMAN 10: My God, she is 
such a slut.
WOMAN 1: Try keeping your legs closed for a change.
WOMAN 2: She cheated on Nate? WOMAN 3: WTF does 
she think she is?
WOMAN 4: Queen B? Try queen whore.
-Have you seen Nate? -No.
-I saw it. -Yeah, Blair's gonna freak out.
I mean, this is a total lie.
Yeah, of course it is.
Jenny. Look, I know you're friends with Blair.
You'd never wanna do anything to betray her, but if you 
know something....
-Well, Blair was never really my friend. -So...?
So yeah.
There's something you should know.
I don't know who would wanna....
Did you sleep with her, huh? You son of a bitch, I ought 
to kill you.
Can we talk without your hands on my neck?
Get what you wanted like you do with other girls?
Yes, I took what Blair kept throwing at you and you kept 
throwing back.
So you screwing Blair for sport is my fault?
It wasn't for sport. She needed someone and I was there.
-Cared about her? -You'd broken up.
For how long, a week? An hour?
I am sorry, I know how long you and I have been best 
friends, okay?
---------------------------------------
No, it's not okay. From now on, you stay away from me.
-Nate. -Did you hear what I said?
You stay the hell away from me, Chuck.
Show's over.
-What are you doing here? -Your mom let me in.
I didn't ask how you got in, I asked why you came.
To talk about us.
-There's no us, Blair. -Yes, there is.
We finally have a chance to start over.
All this time, I felt so bad for everything I've done.
You said leave the past in the past, but we were talking 
about yours.
You had broken my heart. I made a decision I was in no 
condition to make.
-Clear-headed now? -Yes.
You'll understand perfectly when I say I want nothing to 
do with you.
-You deserve each other. -You know Chuck would twist 
the truth.
-But Jenny wouldn't. -Jenny?
Don't go blaming this on her. I would've found out 
eventually.
I said I'm done, it's over.
Now, would you please leave?
Fine. Stay as long as you like.
I'll leave.
Bryn. Hi.
Good to see you again.
Rufus, at the risk of being forward, I'm here on a dare 
---------------------------------------
from my friends... ...to ask you out.
-Then I guess I have to say-- -Yes?
-Yes, you do. -Well, tonight I have plans.
But maybe some other night.
Am I interrupting?
Hi.
-Bryn, Bex. Bex, Bryn. -Actually, I'm Bex.
-She must be.... -Bryn.
I always get a little tongue-tied with my B's.
Looks like you're still tied up. Maybe we should 
reschedule?
No, that won't be necessary.
Actually, I think it will.
Good to meet you, Bryn.
BRYN: You too.
Bye.
Guess you're available after all.
Hey, B. What's up?
I can't believe you told Jenny about me and Chuck.
What, I didn't.
Because of her, everybody knows my private life. And 
Nate's not speaking to me.
But I told you, B, I didn't tell Jenny. I don't know how she 
found out.
Did you tell Dan?
What?
You did.
You told your low-rent boyfriend and he told his sister...
---------------------------------------
...and she blabbed to Nate.
I can't believe you're attacking Dan and Jenny.
Did you or did you not tell him?
I did, but only because you weren't dealing with it...
...and I wanted advice on how to help you.
You don't get it. The rules are different for Serenas of 
the world.
People expect you to party, be wild, sleep around, run 
away, come back.
Are we going back there?
You shot your reputation a long time ago. It doesn't 
matter, but I'm a Waldorf.
Since you and your reputation obviously don't need me 
and my low-rent taste...
...you and the Waldorf name can weather this storm 
alone.
With pleasure.
Hey, Jenny.
-Hi. -Are you joining us?
JENNY: Um.... -What are you doing here?
-I was just leaving. -No, stay.
Blair, given you can barely manage your own messy 
affairs...
...you're not in a position to tell anyone where they can 
eat.
Realize who you're talking to?
You mean a self-righteous bitch who sat on her high 
horse judging everyone else?
Pregnant little hypocrite.
Not that it's any of your business, but I'm not pregnant.
---------------------------------------
Nate must be thrilled.
-Chuck too. -What are you talking about?
The whole school saw them throwing down over your 
cheap ass.
-The boyfriend and the best friend. -Pretty classy.
Consider yourself dethroned, Queen B.
Jenny.
It is highly unlikely that I will ever forgive you for going to 
Nate...
...but if you walk away from me now, I will also ruin you.
How are you gonna do that?
-Good to see you again. -Okay.
-Take care, enjoy. -Thanks.
BEX [ON VOICE MAIL]: Hi, it's Bex. You know what to 
do.
Hi, it's Rufus...
...calling again to apologize about last night, again.
I really didn't mean to insult you, or disrespect you, or 
whatever it is I did.
I'm new at this, and well....
I'm new at this.
You told Jenny about Blair and Chuck?
No, no, of course not.
Well, you're the only one I told.
And I didn't tell anybody.
How can I know that?
Because I gave you my word.
Because I love you.
---------------------------------------
What?
I love you.
And not just because I thought you were pregnant.
Not the way you love a guy who picks up your lit paper...
...or some girl who likes your hair.
Okay.
Okay?
That response is not okay.
-I'm such an ass. -Let me guess. Dan?
He told me he loved me, and all I did was stand like a 
mute.
Why wouldn't I wanna hear those words from him?
But it's like it made me trust him less.
Even if he is lying about Jenny, even though I told him 
not to...
...I should've come up with a better response to "I love 
you."
Why would you think he was lying?
Because I'm the only one who knew, and he's the only 
one I told.
Know how many times I listened to your conversations 
and you thought I wasn't?
-None, I hope. -You hope wrong.
I'm a little brother. It's what I do.
And you don't have to be a genius to figure out the trust 
thing.
Every time Mom brought home someone saying "I love 
you," they end up married.
And then divorced.
Didn't leave us with a strong sense of trust, huh?
---------------------------------------
But that's Mom's issue, not ours.
And Dan's not one of those guys.
Okay, this conversation has to end...
...because you're getting dangerously close to being 
smarter than I am.
-No, thank you. -All right.
I came to congratulate you in person.
You ruined my relationship with Nate, Serena, all of my 
friends.
Even little Jenny thinks she's too good for me, so bravo.
Just like you wanted.
-I have no one to turn to but you. -Actually, you don't 
even have me.
-Enough. -I'll try to be more succinct.
You held a certain fascination...
...when you were beautiful, delicate and untouched.
But now you're like...
...one of the Arabians my father used to own.
Rode hard and put away wet.
I don't want you anymore.
And I can't see why anyone else would.
-You okay? -I'd be a lot better...
...if I could spend a semester going to school in France.
A semester?
Well, I already talked to Harold about a visit, and he was 
thrilled.
So can I go?
-Now? -Mom, please try.
---------------------------------------
-Blair, I am very concerned. -So book a flight.
We'll get you out tomorrow.
Thank you.
Who's up for a Barneys drive-by?
ALL: Me.
Followed by hot sake at Decibel?
Huh. I don't think so.
She made out with the bartender last time, now he thinks 
she loves him.
What about you, little J?
Oh, I can't. I have to return these books to the library.
Elise will take them for you. Won't you, E?
Yeah, sure.
-It's okay, I can do it. -The question isn't if you can do 
it.
It's if you should have to.
I'm going there, anyway.
Okay.
Let me know if you need anything else.
You coming?
Props to Blair. She trained you well.
BEX: Hi.
Hi.
Don't act so surprised to see me.
How could I not stop by after all those pitiful messages 
you left?
For the record, I'm really sorry for what happened the 
other night.
---------------------------------------
So am I.
Look, Bex, I was married for almost 20 years.
And before that, I was a somewhat successful 
musician...
...I wouldn't call what I was doing dating.
-What was it, then? -A succession of women.
Groupies mostly, who chose me.
I really don't have any experience with real, honest-togoodness dating.
Despite your worst efforts, I am charmed by you, Rufus 
Humphrey.
Thanks, I think.
Okay, here's where we are:
Dating 101.
Lesson one: In two days, you're gonna call me...
...and thank me for forgiving you of your dating faux pas.
You'll ask me out to dinner, someplace elegant...
...but intimate, and we're gonna have a fabulous time.
-You got that? -Absolutely.
Good. Talk to you in two days.
-Two days. -Okay.
Hello?
I never was good at following rules.
Hey. What are you doing here?
I need to know why you love me.
Because I do.
I really wanna trust you when you say those words, Dan.
So maybe if I knew why, I'd stop being scared of hearing 
---------------------------------------
them...
...and afraid to say them.
Okay.
Wanna talk about why--
It has to do with my mom and her many marriages.
There. That's why.
Because I actually like it when you interrupt me, which is 
often, by the way.
I love you because you make no apologies... ...about 
being exactly who you are.
Beautiful, smart, sexy as hell.
-Now you're embarrassing me. -That's another reason.
You're completely unaware of your effect on me.
You're also completely unaware that you laugh like a 4-
year-old.
Just like that.
And I love you because you can be with someone like 
me...
...and still be best friends with someone like Blair.
-Yeah, well, I try to be. -I know you do.
And that's not easy.
But you never give up on her.
That is how amazing you are.
Well, you're amazing too.
For being able to say all of those things.
You just are.
And I love you.
But I have to go.
---------------------------------------
What is it this time?
One of the many reasons you love me.
SERENA: Blair.
What?
You want a lift to JFK?
Your mom said you were going to France tonight.
-Yeah, she has a big mouth. -B, I'm your best friend.
-She was shocked I didn't know. -Well, now you do.
What I know is how you felt when I left without telling 
you.
-Is there a reason you're here? -Stay.
Don't let some stupid scandal make you run away like it 
did me.
Like it does everyone in our world.
Everything's horrible.
-My whole life has fallen apart. -So rebuild it.
You're a Waldorf, remember?
People don't tell you who you are. You tell them.
Stay and fight.
I'll fight with you.
I'm so embarrassed.
-I'm so-- -So what?
Start over.
It can be done. I should know.
We can get through this together.
Promise?
Promise.
---------------------------------------
BLAIR: Stop, guys.
I'm going home.
GOSSIP GIRL: One good scandal deserves another.
Wonder who's going down next?
Everybody, if B has anything to say about it.
You know you love me.
XOXO, Gossip Girl.
End

WOMAN: Where has she been?
GOSSIP GIRL: And who am I? That's one secret I'll never 
tell.
You know you love me. XOXO...
...Gossip Girl.
Cat?
Cat!
Cat!
Cat?
Cat!
You don't have a cat, Jenny.
My name is Blair.
You don't have anyone.
But I'm Blair.
I'm Blair!
DOROTA: Miss Blair. Miss Blair.
Miss Blair. GOSSIP GIRL: Wakey wakey, Upper East 
Siders.
Spring break is done and I'm starved for the dish.
Were you sunning in Capri or sinning in Croatia?
-Give me the deets. -What's happening?
You have bad dream and you're sleeping with your 
---------------------------------------
chocolates.
Ohhh. Lady Godiva. My only friend.
And has anyone spotted our ex-queen bee?
Where does the dethroned royalty vacation these days?
Club Bed is over. First day back to school.
I can't, Dorota.
-I don't feel very well. -Serena come to get you soon.
Call her and cancel. And cover my mirrors.
I'm in mourning for my former life.
Chuck, I'm serious.
Are you done yet? This is my bathroom.
It's late, and not to mention disgusting.
Chuck!
What are you doing?
All right, ladies. My sister needs to shower, make room.
I'm just messing with you.
I can't believe you lit up in my bathroom.
Well, if I lit up in mine, then the folks would know it was 
me, sis.
Okay, let's get one thing straight.
Our parents may be insisting on blending our 
households, but I am not your sister.
I do not share any of your DNA, nor do I ever wish to.
Then I suggest you get new hand towels.
Okay, it's imperative that I bathe.
Can you just get out? You know what?
Fine, just forget it.
---------------------------------------
Next year, we'll do spring break in Maldives. Skiing is too 
dangerous.
You broke your arm in the spa.
Oh, here, Hazel. Thanks for letting me borrow it.
-What is this? -The bracelet you lent me in Aspen.
Oh, yeah.
You could have just kept it and I would have forgot I had 
it.
Girls, how excited are we?
Party tomorrow night for Jenny at Socialista.
It's gonna be my best birthday ever. I heard the mojitos 
are amazing.
Wait till you get your mouth around a mini Cuban.
-Oh, I don't-- -It's a sandwich.
-Oh. -Wardrobe, ladies? My Ferragamo clutch.
And whatever dress I buy today to go with it.
-What about you, J? -I've got dresses on hold at 
Bendel's.
There's an ATM. You said you wanted to hit it.
You know, to pay Penelope back for brunch?
Oh, uh-- Yeah, 120, right?
Yeah, I don't feel like stopping. You could get the next 
one.
-What are you doing? -I'm hiding from my valet.
He wanted to put my socks on for me. Your servants are 
very attentive.
You should meet Brigita, the new Latvian maid.
No, no, he should not meet Brigita. He's 14.
Avoid this person.
CHUCK: May I remind you that you used to have a sense 
---------------------------------------
of humor?
-No. -Morning, father.
-Hey. -Good morning, kids.
And how is Lily von Bulow today?
Oh. I have a headache.
I had a very frustrating conversation with the wedding 
planner this morning.
Well, may I say aggravation becomes you?
You may, but I won't believe it.
So first day back at school, huh?
Honey, you didn't want to shower?
I have to go meet Blair. Eric?
Go ahead. We'll take the limo.
As my best man, I expect you to keep things smooth until 
the wedding.
Best man?
I'd be honored, sir.
To family.
DAN: I came from the airport to drive Jenny, and she's 
already gone?
-She slept at Hazel's last night. -Oh. Who's Hazel?
Her new friend, a girl whose family she went with to 
Aspen.
I was surprised you let her go, cancel on Mom like that.
Your mom was in complete support of it. Jenny was well 
taken care of.
I spoke to her every day, twice from the private plane.
Private plane?
It's the best birthday present we could give her.
---------------------------------------
-So you paid for it? -I gave her pocket money.
Yeah, Jenny's happier than she's been in a long time.
Hey, whenever you're done with that I'd-do-thingsdifferently look, two things:
One, I can't seem to nail Jenny down...
...on what she wants to do for her actual birthday.
-I'll get it out of her. -Good, and two:
What the hell are you still doing here?
Thank you.
At least you get to wake up from your nightmare. I'm 
living with mine.
Thank God I have plans with Dan tonight.
Finally, the return of some normalcy.
B, what are you doing?
Giving homeschooling some serious consideration.
Look, I know you think everybody's still talking about you.
But your three-week-old scandal is ancient news.
-Hear the dirt that happened over break? -Who would I 
have heard it from, Dorota?
Well, after much-concerted effort...
...Mya finally made it into Brodie Jenner's cell phone. 
Ugh.
Oh, and Connie's dad moved her entire family back to 
Israel.
Yeah.
And Constance's bad-girl-turned-good Serena van der 
Woodsen...
...moved in with Chuck Bass.
So you're thinking this whole thing could have blown over 
by now?
---------------------------------------
Come on.
That too.
Don't worry, B.
GOSSIP GIRL: The French revolution had cake.
Come on, let's go.
The American revolution had tea.
But looks like the overthrow of Blair Waldorf, well....
Who said you need a silver spoon to dole out just 
desserts?
Give it up, man.
Hey, Jenny, can I talk to you just for a second?
I'll meet up with you guys, okay?
Hey, so I may have told Blair you told me the truth about 
her and Chuck...
...and I'm sure she didn't react well to that...
...but you don't know what you're dealing with here.
-Oh. I'm not scared of Blair, Nate. -No, I'm not talking 
about--
I'm talking about your new circle.
They've been friends with Blair forever and look what 
they're doing to her.
I mean, you fall out of line, what do you think's gonna 
happen to you?
-Well, then I won't fall out of line. -I'm not saying you're 
gonna....
Look, it's just, you're not like those girls, Jenny.
That's weird, since they're my friends... ...you'd think we 
have some stuff in common.
Okay.
Well, I will give you this. You've got good aim.
---------------------------------------
I know this is hard, but you can't let them beat you.
You're Blair Waldorf, remember?
Right. Right.
These are my steps and I'm not going to relinquish them 
without a fight.
Though it would be helpful if maybe there was one more 
person in our crowd.
Only old people and children and, ugh, there's Chuck.
With a blond mini-Chuck.
He's trying to torture me.
-I can't believe it. -I know.
Does little J actually think that she's anything but their 
lackey?
-Hey. -Hey.
So since when does Nate Archibald have so much to say 
to Jenny Humphrey?
Why? You guys don't like him?
Penelope's only had a historic crush on him since the 
20th century.
Since you and Nate are so tight, maybe you can broker 
that.
Yeah, maybe.
They what?
They're taking her out to dinner for her birthday.
Table service at Socialista.
So Jenny Humphrey is officially being inscribed on the 
A-list.
Wait, how do you know this?
Because they invited me, but I said no out of deference 
to you.
I just thought I could have dinner with her and Dan and 
---------------------------------------
the whole family.
How do you manage to get out of everything unscathed?
Because I'm nice. You should try it sometime.
Come on, compliment me. Tell me my hair looks 
beautiful.
But your hair looks disgusting. Did you even shower?
B, I say this out of love...
...but your being a bitch is what got dairy in your hair in 
the first place, okay?
Be nice and neutral and things will swim back to normal.
You're the queen bee, so just let nature take its course.
I'm going to Model U.N., but we're dining tonight.
Butter, 7:00. I don't know if I can go out again tonight.
-Why? What are you doing? -Do we have a reservation?
Yeah, doesn't it take like two weeks to get a table there?
Not if you slip the maitre'd a hundred.
Oh, and don't forget, J, you owe me.
You know, I've got a better idea.
What's she doing?
What does she think she's doing?
She's giving you the perfect opportunity for niceness. 
Come on.
-No. -Yes.
Serena, I know you're doing something with Dan 
tonight...
...but, Blair, we're going to Butter and I was wondering 
if you wanted to join us.
She'd be delighted. Yes, Butter.
-Great. -Great.
---------------------------------------
-Very nice. -Thank you.
Do you always look this good? You look so good today.
You look so good to me. And you smell so clean.
You're not gonna tell me the Chuck-shower story again.
-No. -Good.
Dan?
-Chuck, how are you? -Excellent. Enjoying having family 
around.
Can you get it over with?
Say whatever pervy thing you're gonna say and leave?
The wedding caterer is presenting a tasting to the family.
I was coming to call you to dinner.
-Okay. I'll take off, then. -No need.
I already asked the staff to set a place for you.
I have to say I prefer the chestnut pappardelle.
Yeah, the foie gras is a bit rich.
I'm slanting heavily towards the venison fellow.
[WHISPERS] It's fallow. Fallow. Fallow, exactly. Fallow.
-Oh. For me? -Miss.
-Thank you. -Who's it from?
I don't know, but it says "open immediately."
-Do I have to refrigerate it? -No, it's not from me. I don't 
know.
Oh, don't put your dirty package on the table.
If I had a dime for every time I heard that.
That's enough, Chuck.
Porn and handcuffs? Really?
---------------------------------------
-Oh, my. -Wow.
-This is low, Chuck, even for you. CHUCK: What?
I didn't send this.
-Ahem. If you'll excuse me. -Could you...?
Oh, yeah, my pleasure.
It's not-- That's not what I-- I didn't mean that.
It's trash, I'll throw it out.
GOSSIP GIRL: Spotted: Blair Waldorf alone at Butter.
I'm sorry, miss, but it looks like your friends aren't 
coming.
Humiliated, party of one.
Can't you just picture her sitting there?
Every time someone comes in the door, "It's not them. 
No, not them."
Not going to Butter is so much better than going to 
Butter.
My new Nanette Lepore for Jenny's birthday.
-Gorgeous. -Wow.
-Right. -What's the birthday girl wearing?
Oh. I'm still deciding between two dresses at Bergdorf's.
-I thought you said Bendel's. -Bendel's, right.
Oh, it's my dad.
-Is, are you wearing your black Chanel? JENNY: Hello?
Which one?
You know I never wear the same thing twice. Mommy 
taught me well.
-Hey, Dad. RUFUS: You missed dinner, kiddo.
Oh, yeah, I'm studying at Hazel's and I guess I lost track 
of time.
---------------------------------------
I'm not mad. I just feel I haven't seen you in a while.
We haven't even discussed your birthday.
I was gonna do something with my friends.
Oh. That's great, honey.
But since I have nothing to wear, I don't think that's 
happening anymore.
If you wanna be with friends, we can do the family thing 
over the weekend.
Sweetheart?
Yeah, I'll be home soon, Dad.
Okay, bye.
-Hello. Hi. -Oh.
No check, honey, the drink's on us, unless you want 
something else.
Yes, another Bellini, the seared squab...
...and a bus person to separate the tables, please.
Okay.
GOSSIP GIRL: One may be the loneliest number.
MAN [OVER PHONE]: Information. City and state, 
please. Brooklyn. I think that's in New York.
GOSSIP GIRL: But sometimes only the lonely can play.
Wake up, little Jenny, the bitch is back.
I thought you said you didn't have anything else.
Well, I found some stuff in the back of my closet. Mmhm.
Do you wanna go with cash again...
...or do you wanna buy your sewing machine back?
Neither.
I want that dress.
---------------------------------------
Honey, this is $1200.
Well, this one's quite lovely.
Yeah, well, that's more my color.
I say we take the jet to Croatia...
...where Eric can exploit the lesser age of consent.
-I'm invited to the bachelor party? -Please.
And then head west to Monte Carlo for some all-night 
cards at Metropole...
...and swing by Giza just to watch the sun come up over 
the pyramids.
What do you think, father?
I think we're here.
-See you at home, Bart. Heh. -Chuck will catch up in a 
minute.
You almost ruined things between me and Lily once 
before.
-I'm not gonna let that happen again. -What are you 
talking about?
I'm talking about that stunt you pulled.
I didn't send Serena that package...
...and quite frankly, her violated Virgin Mary act is getting 
pretty old.
I thought making you my best man would help.
What is that supposed to mean?
Inspire you to value my happiness above your own 
childish agenda.
Things seem to be working out for you at that club, 
Victrola.
I'm thinking you might like me to invest more in the place.
So you can have more control.
---------------------------------------
In exchange for good behavior, of course.
You're bribing me.
So we have a deal, then?
SERENA: Why aren't you at school? BLAIR: I'm taking the 
morning off.
Volunteering to help those less fortunate than myself.
Wow, you're in a good mood.
Butter with the girls must've gone well last night.
I didn't go, actually.
Why not?
I figure they should work a little harder for my 
forgiveness.
Dan's not hanging out in Brooklyn again this morning.
He's with you at school, right? No, not yet, but he'll be 
here soon, why?
Just tell him I say hi.
Okay.
Hi. Jenny's dad? We met briefly at Thanksgiving.
Yeah. Hi.
I've got three cases of champagne for Serena van der 
Woodsen.
Oh, no, no. I'm Serena van der Woodsen, but those 
aren't mine.
Well, the purchase order never lies, salut.
ISABEL: She must have been so angry.
Hey, guys, I just got this incredible Dolce. You wanna 
see?
It's unbelievable. You can't turn your back in your own 
house.
-What are you talking about? -My mother's Valentino 
---------------------------------------
was stolen.
-Oh, my God. -It was made especially for her.
It was the same year he did Jackie O's lace wedding 
mini.
Well, did someone break in?
No, and the maid swore to the police she didn't take it 
but she'll probably get fired.
Wait, police? For a dress?
It's worth like $15,000.
If she returned it, they could work something out.
Like she'll bring it back.
Well, you never know. I mean, it could turn up.
Right, because, really, where's she gonna wear it?
I'm really glad, because when I spoke to her... ...she said 
the plans with the girls fell through.
Nope.
-Tell you the truth, I didn't believe her. -Why?
I thought she was just conflicted about choosing friends 
over family.
Well, you know that's the biggest struggle with a girl her 
age.
Memory doesn't serve--
Trying to reconcile who you're becoming with who you 
used to be.
She's been running herself ragged, Mr. Humphrey.
Straddling two worlds.
I know she was running herself ragged trying to get into 
one of those worlds...
...picking up dry-cleaning, gowns for masked balls.
Well, it's no easier once you're in.
---------------------------------------
She needs some relief.
Well, then, that's what she'll get.
Whatever I can do to help.
Oh, thank God. Betty? Hi, excuse me.
Would you pardon me for a moment, please?
I need to trade back.
You can keep the scarf and shoes but I need to give you 
this for the red one.
Well, honey, I'm sorry, but that's just not gonna be 
possible.
What? Why?
When you leave here with an item, you're agreeing to its 
value.
The Dolce sold at 1200.
The Valentino-- Ha-ha. --is seven times that.
This has sentimental value and I didn't realize--
No, I'm sorry.
A couple of hours ago, this dress was mine. It doesn't 
even have tags on it yet.
Look, it's not my fault that you don't know what a 
Valentino's worth.
Hello?
-Nate, it's Jenny. -What's going on?
I wouldn't be calling you if I had anyone else to turn to...
...but I made a mistake and I need to borrow some 
money.
Wait, wait, Jenny, just slow down.
-I promise I'll pay you back. -Is everything okay?
Yeah, I just-- I made a mistake and I need to fix it.
---------------------------------------
-Well, how much? -Eight thousand dollars.
Eight thousand dollars?
Jenny, what do you need that kind of money for?
You know what? Forget it. I'm sorry I bothered you.
GOSSIP GIRL: The price of fitting in may have gotten a 
little steeper...
...but little J still knows it's what's underneath that 
counts.
WOMAN: Here's the second choice for the centerpiece.
LILY: We could put this one on a Mylar tablecloth...
...and pretend it's a bar mitzvah.
Let's go back to the more understated style.
-Oh, there you are. -I have a date with Dan.
Could you excuse us? Thank you.
Say something worse than the bar mitzvah remark?
I think we should talk about any feelings...
...you might be having about my upcoming marriage.
Okay, but you're asking me this now because...?
Because I got a call from your headmistress...
...who said that there was something about a case of 
alcohol.
Well, I thought you may be acting out.
Right, Mom. I actually woke up this morning and I 
thought:
"Hmm. I'm uncertain about my mother's wedding.
Why don't I invite the entire junior class... ...out to the 
courtyard for a champagne toast?"
You have pulled things like this before. Obviously, 
Chuck's master plan is working.
---------------------------------------
I can't believe you think Chuck is doing this.
Looking good to everyone in my life isn't enough for him.
He has to make me look bad or crazy.
Well, Chuck may be eccentric, but I doubt he's 
diabolical.
What's he done now?
I'll tell you what he's done.
ALL: Surprise!
-Wow. -Happy birthday, Jenny.
Dad, I can't believe you did all this.
And Blair's here.
This is so great that all of you are here in my house.
I should go change.
You got it?
-I don't think she was surprised. -What's Blair doing 
here?
-I don't know. This party's kind of weird. -Weird?
It's time for its induction to the birthday hall of lame.
ISABEL: So not what I pictured when the guy on the 
phone said loft party.
Can't believe we gave up our table for this. Mint mojitos 
at Socialista.
Mint Milanos with Jenny's dad.
-He's kind of a hottie. -Yeah, a hottie dad.
-How long do we have to stay? -Rice Krispy treats?
You can't believe how mad Bart was.
Yes, I can because you've told me about three times.
I wonder what they're gonna do. I wish I could see his 
face.
---------------------------------------
I've got some stories too.
About seeing my mother for the first time since she left 
at Christmas.
-I'm the worst girlfriend. -You're not.
There's the funny visit to my grandma, at the old folks' 
home.
Two women, a sponge bath and a bedpan.
I'm sorry, you're right. I wanna be here right now, with 
you.
-And Nate. -What?
-Hey, guys. -Hey.
Sorry to interrupt. Your mom told me you guys were here.
Could I speak with you for one second?
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Okay.
-Have you spoken with your sister today? -No, why? 
What's wrong?
I don't know. She called me.
She was freaked out, didn't know where to turn, she 
asked to borrow $8000.
-What? Why? -I don't know.
I tried to get her to tell me what was going on, but she 
wouldn't say anything.
Please, Dad, just get out, okay? I need to change.
Honey, can't you tell me what's going on? Nothing, Dad, 
okay? Just leave.
Why are you crying? Are you upset?
No, can't we just talk about this later? I really just need 
to get out of this dress.
-Aah! It's stuck. -Okay, all right.
---------------------------------------
Just help me, okay? Help me get it off.
-Jenny, you have to calm down. -No. Hurry up.
-Did you get it? -I need a pair of pliers.
Dad.... Ugh.
-Sorry, we were looking for our wraps. -I'll get them.
Oh, my God. That's my mother's dress.
No, you guys. I got this at Resurrection.
Remember I was telling you about the dress I bought?
Her mother's one-of-a-kind Valentino that happened to 
disappear?
She must have given it away and forgotten or something.
Are you calling my daughter a thief?
-Wha--? -Excuse me.
This feels private, so I'm gonna head out now.
I have a table at Butter.
Reservation's under Waldorf in case there's an after 
party.
GOSSIP GIRL: Spotted: Jenny in a red dress with the red 
hands to match.
Looks like Utter Disgrace is the name on the label.
Blair said they told you the original party had fallen 
through...
...so that they could surprise you with a better one.
Blair's a liar. You got played.
She also said you were afraid the girls wouldn't accept 
everything about you.
She knew you were wrong...
...and she wanted you to feel like you had nothing to be 
ashamed of.
---------------------------------------
Is that a lie too?
Where did you get the dress?
And I know you didn't make it because your sewing 
machine is gone.
[CRYING] You have no idea how hard it is, Dad.
-I sold my sewing machine, okay? -What?
-Yeah, and a lamp and some jewelry. -Why?
Because I had to.
You think you can just send me off to school...
...with a plaid skirt and a MetroCard and everything will 
be okay.
I am not apologizing for not having a private plane for 
you, Jenny.
You think I'm ashamed of where I come from?
No, Dad, what I'm ashamed of is having to bring... ...a 
brown-bagged lunch to school...
...and eat it in the bathroom, and then go out with my 
friends...
...and pretend I'm not hungry when I go to lunch with 
them.
You don't have to do those things, Jenny.
You're making a choice.
What don't you get?
Do you want me to choose to have no friends?
Or clearly, I mean, that's not even a choice anymore 
because that's just done.
NATE: I should probably get back now.
So thank you for staying with me while I hid out from my 
house of horrors.
-No problem. -So you think Jenny will be all right?
---------------------------------------
Yeah, Dan's a good guy. He'll take care of her.
You are too, you know, a good guy.
A forgiving guy who can't pit himself against Blair 
forever.
-Good night. -I'm sorry.
You gave me an opening I couldn't resist.
-I'm just saying. NATE: How you doing?
Good night. Hey, where have you been?
-Therapy. -For four hours?
Well, before I was playing Wii tennis with Chuck... ...at 
this guy named Brenforth's house.
-Why are you hanging out with him? -Brenforth?
Chuck is fun, okay?
He's cool and he doesn't treat me like some freak that 
just got out of Ostroff.
Who treats you like that?
Guys at St. Jude's, the girls at Constance... ...Suke at 
the Korean deli on 75th street.
-Eric. -And he's not--
He's not always careful around me, like one bad thing 
and I'll break or something.
Besides, I always wanted a brother. I'm trying it out, you 
know? Here.
-What's this? -Chuck said it came for you.
He thought you might wanna open it out of the house, 
just in case.
Why didn't he bring it to me?
Because he thought you wanted him to stay away from 
you.
Whoa. Is that coke?
---------------------------------------
How do you like a brother who uses you as a drug mule?
Serena, I....
-Hey, who turned 12? -Please, don't rub it in.
Dad, what happened?
Hey.
You okay?
You wanna tell me why you needed to borrow $8000?
Not really.
I can't believe Nate told you.
Well, he was worried about you...
...that you might be turning into some hideous, upraised 
cyborg.
-He said that? -No, no. I did.
I just got in way over my head.
You know, I thought I could trade the dress... ...and wear 
it for a night and return it.
I just....
Look...
...it's your birthday, so I think we should get some ice 
cream...
...and we can talk about all this stuff later, okay?
Okay. I'll just let Dad know what we're gonna do.
Jen, you have so much more to offer than the things that 
those girls have.
Really, you've got so much more to bring to the table.
You just need to find a way to believe that.
Okay?
-What the hell's your problem? -Specify the context.
---------------------------------------
You disgust me, Chuck.
How dare you involve Eric in something like this?
No wonder you're friendless, girlfriendless.
Even your own father expects the worst from you.
Well, you saw to that.
If we're gonna exist under the same roof, I am laying 
down some house rules.
No need, princess. Bart already kicked me out.
-What? -I'm moving back to my suite.
Bart thought it would be best if the family bonded without 
me for a while.
There's a line outside. You ready to give up your table 
yet?
No, my party's coming.
[LOUDER] They're coming.
These seats taken?
GOSSIP GIRL: Any good general knows... ...you never 
let your soldiers see you sweat.
Looks like this battle's ending at Butter, and the win 
belongs to B.
Victory is sweet.
I don't want Jenny leaving this house soon.
I know, Dad, but it's her birthday and I kind of promised 
her.
Since you don't make the decisions... ...she'll have to 
take that with a grain of salt.
Okay, I'm sorry. What're you gonna do?
-Keep her locked up? -I don't know.
Last week, Aspen, this week, prison?
Yeah, well, spring break is over for everyone, including 
---------------------------------------
myself.
I really took my eye off the ball.
So, what do you wanna do?
Why don't we just celebrate 15 with some Jenny cake in 
the kitchen?
Okay. All right, I'll go tell her.
So, Jen....
-She's gone. -What?
She's not in there. She's gone.
Hey, I'm sorry for calling you like that earlier.
I'm so embarrassed.
-I mean, it was stupid and inappropriate. -No, no, no.
Listen, I'm just glad you're okay.
[CHUCKLES] Yeah.
Okay, well, I do have a favor to ask you.
I mean, it's not money, but I just really don't wanna be 
alone on my birthday.
-Here you are. -Oh, for me? Thank you.
Oh, my God.
-Yeah, I know. -What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'll be back.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm going to the bar.
-What? -Bar!
We'll be right back.
-Where are all the hot guys? -I don't know.
---------------------------------------
They don't exactly serve tea and cupcakes here, Jenny.
-Twenty minutes. -Is this really happening?
Penelope, you know Nate, right?
-Of course. Hi. -Hi.
NATE: How are you? Good to see you again.
Hazel, I think maybe your mom did give away that 
Valentino.
Yeah, she is always cleaning out her closet...
...and that Ativan can really play with her memory.
Hey.
I'm really sorry, Chuck.
I know it wasn't you who sent me that stuff.
GOSSIP GIRL: Never thought I'd say this, but it turns out 
Chuck Bass is innocent.
So who did send S all those naughty gifts?
Why don't I make you a drink?

WOMAN: Where has she been?
GOSSIP GIRL: And who am I?
That's one secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me. XOXO...
...Gossip Girl.
There are three things we do alone:
We are born, we die...
...and if we're a high school junior headed for college, 
we take the SATs.
And while the test is said to measure our best traits...
...preparing for it inevitably brings out the worst.
Humility becomes self-doubt.
Striving becomes obsession.
Some are driven to self-medication.
While others cling to the security of being part of a 
group.
And anyone who's used to bending the rules...
...will find themselves breaking them.
-Dad, don't ever do that again. -Just doing what I was 
told. Time's up.
I was instructed, when time was up, share that 
information.
Yes, but the manner you went about it was like 
---------------------------------------
humiliating me.
-How bad? -Uh, half.
I finished exactly half in the allotted time. You know 
you're a smart kid.
-I'm a choker, I choke. -Just in your head.
T-ball, first grade. Remember this? Bases loaded and I 
struck out.
-You were 6. -The ball was on a tee. Not moving.
-You'll come through. -You're basing that on what 
exactly?
-Blind faith. -Bye.
Wait.
-I'm gonna be late. -I'm coming with you.
-You're walking me to school? -I need exercise.
One mistake doesn't mean I need a human ankle 
monitor.
You used to beg me, you'd cry if I didn't. That wasn't 
me, that was Dan.
It's true, but I was 6 and it was an emotional time. It was 
post T-ball.
What you did was wrong and really out of character.
Grounding you is not about punishment. We need time 
together, reconnect.
Yeah, I want that too. Just not in public and in front of 
my friends.
All right, tonight, dinner.
Okay, but I have group rehearsal. I'm the alto.
I'm really proud, but we are connecting this evening over 
lasagna.
DAN: Jen, you wanna wait up for a second? We can take 
the--
---------------------------------------
All right, I'll see you at school.
-Twenty-two hundred. Fair. -That's 90th percentile.
Which means Nelly Yuki probably got 2300.
You don't even talk to her. Why do you care how she 
does?
Nelly Yuki has her sights set on Yale too.
What are the odds of accepting two girls from 
Constance?
And have you seen Nelly Yuki's extracurriculars?
-I need to kick her well-rounded ass. -They say you've 
lost your edge.
Nelly Yuki must be destroyed.
-Why do you keep saying her name? -Because it's Nelly 
Yuki.
-Gross, incoming, Chuck. You ready? -No, I gotta wait 
for Dan. He's stressed.
-He doesn't do well on tests, so.... -Performance 
anxiety?
Bye, Blair.
She really needs to tone down on the social niceties. It's 
embarrassing.
The two of you are gonna have to work out your issues.
What issues? I'm issue-free.
-And based on my research, so are you. -Georgina?
According to my very reliable sources...
...Georgina is nowhere near our fair isle.
She's in Switzerland dating the prince of Belfort.
There's a prince of Belfort? And she's dating him? Thank 
God.
Well, you can enjoy the gifts she mailed you with peace 
of mind...
---------------------------------------
...and maybe Chuck in the room.
Oh, shoot, except we're siblings.
Georgie always brought out the devil in you.
A part of me is disappointed she's not here.
-Hm. Which part? -Been a while since I saw the old 
Serena.
Thanks to her, the new one has to break 2000 on her 
SATs.
-So if you could just go smarm elsewhere. -The offer 
still stands.
I know a lovely little redhead that's just dying to be you 
for the day.
I'll leave the cheating to you, Chuck. I plan on taking the 
SATs myself.
PENELOPE: You have no idea how lucky you are.
Seriously, Jenny, I would do anything to be a freshman 
again.
Junior year sucks. Nate doesn't call, I'm not ready for 
the SATs.
Maybe I should join Kati on the kibbutz in Israel. Quit 
now.
You guys, it's just a test.
Look, cram session tonight, my dad's making lasagna.
My brother's got tons of flash cards and I'm available to 
help.
That won't be necessary, little J.
You girls are all taken care of, courtesy of Blair Waldorf 
SAT Prep and Spa.
-Serious? BLAIR: If you sweat the test...
...it better not clog your pores.
This evening at my penthouse...
...you'll find personal tutors, hot stone massages, mani-
---------------------------------------
pedis...
...and an acupuncturist specializing in mental acuity.
-That beats my dad's lasagna. BLAIR: I'll Flickr over 
photos for you.
It's upperclassmen only. I'm sure you understand.
Totally.
Wait up, B.
So glad I didn't book that flight to Tel Aviv.
GOSSIP GIRL: Spotted in the halls of Constance:
Little J realizing that age really does come before beauty.
-SATs? -Yeah. Yeah, and soccer?
Why not give the old ball a kick? Season's just around 
the corner in October.
No, I have to stop doing that.
I'll just focus on myself and my test and my prep.
What other people do, don't do this about them.
Not a good tester, huh?
Oh, Chuck, I had no idea you felt that way about me.
Good to know you're at least still kind of funny.
Hey, I'm so sorry, I've been off the radar the past few 
days.
-New home, new family, it's okay. -Yeah, it's pretty 
overwhelming.
Yeah, I've been a little overwhelmed myself lately.
SERENA: Wanna hang out?
-Study? -Ooh.
I wanna take whatever prep course you're signed up for.
Well, it's not too late.
---------------------------------------
Okay, I'm gonna....
I'll see you.
You always did know how to leave them wanting more.
Oh, my God, Georgina.
SERENA: What are you doing here? -I told you I was 
coming.
Didn't you get my gifts?
You're supposed to be in Switzerland dating a prince.
Luckily, Daddy didn't need the G5. Haven't you missed 
me?
-How could I not? -Okay.
You don't wanna throw me a homecoming party, I get it.
But let's have a cocktail, catch up.
S, you're really gonna hurt my feelings.
And you know how I get when my feelings are hurt.
Great, I'll see you tonight. So weird seeing you.
It's almost like I never left.
Spotted in the courtyard:
Serena looking like she's seen a ghost. The ghost of 
parties past.
Here you go.
-Jenny, why did you wanna meet here? JENNY: Well, I've 
been thinking.
What's the one thing no one in our group has, I mean, 
not even Blair.
Compassion?
No, a boyfriend.
-If I'm gonna make queen, I need a king. -Queen 
Elizabeth never had a boyfriend.
But she only had the Spanish to conquer and I have Blair
---------------------------------------
Waldorf.
Let's talk qualifications. He has to be cute, but not full 
of himself.
He has to be from the right kind of family.
Ugh. But not disgusting.
MAN: Come on.
-So sorry. Are you okay? -Yeah.
My lunch isn't, though.
MAN: Oh. Linus.
Let me give you my last dollar.
I couldn't.
You shouldn't be walking the streets with no money.
-Let's just settle for an IOU, then. -It's just a hot dog.
That's just my excuse to give this to you.
Here's my number.
Thank you.
I mean, it's fine. I mean, I'm really not even that hungry.
Well, if you change your mind.
What are you doing? He's gorgeous.
He's a dog walker. I need a king, not a jester.
Come on, let's go lurk outside Dalton.
-Hey. -Vanessa.
You're Nate, right? You play a small, but crucial role in 
my video project.
I remember you following Dan around with your video 
camera.
Hey, Nate, what are you doing here? I mean, I know the 
coffee's good.
---------------------------------------
Since I've taken every SAT prep class in the five 
boroughs... ...why not pay it forward?
-So you don't need these? -I've already taken it.
My parents don't want me in USC.
I had to make sure my scores were good enough to get 
in without help.
Which, thanks to these books, they were, so I'm done.
While we love hearing about the struggles of the idle
rich...
...Dan's got a fine tutor right here.
I ace every practice test I take. We don't need your 
hand-me-downs.
This is actually pretty good. This looks good, thank you.
Is there a reason you insist on looking needy?
Been like that since we were kids. Venomous without 
provocation.
-Better than a charity case. -Rude too.
I see that, yeah.
I gotta get going, but I hope these are useful.
Oh, yeah, yeah, very. Definitely. Thank you.
What? Hey, every little bit helps.
SERENA: Is this really the best place for us to talk?
You of all people know nothing gets me talking like a 
cosmo.
A lot has changed since we used to hang out, Georgie.
-I know, I get it. -No, you don't get it.
Or you wouldn't have sent me all those so-called gifts.
Oh, come on, sweetie, those were funny.
Get over yourself. I was trying to make you laugh.
How about this? How about for one night, we hang out 
---------------------------------------
like old times?
But unlike old times, I won't get out of control.
Unless you want me to. I could get out-- No, okay.
I won't get out of control and I totally respect that.
Please, stop me any time you feel like answering.
Any time. Come on.
One drink, but only one.
Cheers.
-Where are all the tutors? -And the masseuses?
-And the smoothies? -All I've promised you is waiting.
While it gives me pleasure to think of us crossing that 
SAT finish line together...
...before the race can begin, you need to be made aware 
of one little thing.
Nelly Yuki. Top in our class, summer-schooled at the 
Sorbonne.
Lots of people do summer at Sorbonne, including me.
True.
Penelope, you may be a National Merit scholar...
...but Nelly Yuki is a Merit scholar, a Peabody scholar...
...and an Intel Science Talent Search finalist.
Isabel, you're a concert pianist...
...but Itzhak Perlman himself gave Nelly her very first 
violin.
Hazel?
You're just along for the ride, okay?
If we want to live out our college dreams...
...we have to find Nelly Yuki's weakness and exploit it.
---------------------------------------
So, what's it gonna be? Aromatherapy or annihilation?
What's the plan?
GEORGINA: It was the worst thing ever. And do you 
remember?
You remember when we ran out of money and I had to 
flash the bartender?
Because we ran....
Wait, wait. Oh, my God.
Remember when we were Savannah and Svetlana?
-Savannah. -Savannah.
-I forgot about Savannah and Svetlana. -Svetlana.
Wait, no, I think we were Tiffany and Angel that night.
Oh, you could talk me into anything.
Hey, ladies, can I get you guys another round?
No, thank you.
[IN RUSSIAN ACCENT] My American girlfriend, so 
uptight.
They think the drink leads to the sex.
[IN TEXAN ACCENT] No, no, no, I wasn't being rude.
I just didn't wanna take anything if I couldn't offer 
anything in return.
We'd be happy with just one dance.
I'm afraid I have two left feet.
Oh, this is what is the practice for. Come on, lady.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] That's so good. Hold on, hold on. 
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Who is that?
No one. Thank you for calling back, it's just some--
Nadine the beauty queen, how can I help you?
MAN: I don't have time for this. You want one G or two?
---------------------------------------
-Can you just give it--? -Some dealer you know?
I didn't realize I brought my grandmother.
I have to go.
Hey.
I'm so stupid. So, so, so stupid.
You don't sound stupid, you sound drunk. What have you 
been into?
Georgina.
Good news is she doesn't want anything except a party.
Bad news is I partied.
Care to paint a picture? Does this party require clothes?
I'm supposed to be at Dan's, studying.
I called to tell him I'd be late, but not this late.
I just have to call him and say--
That instead of studying with him, you're out with your 
old pal Georgina.
No, I don't want him to know she exists. My mom, Blair, 
even you can't stand her.
Dan, of all people, cannot know Georgie.
Can you help me?
-Say you need me. -Chuck.
Hearing you scream my name is more than enough.
I'll take care of it and pick you up in 10.
Hey, I've been wondering where you were. You mean all 
of your life?
Don't take this the wrong way, Serena... ...but you sound 
just like this jackass we know.
Serena has food poisoning. She's too sick to come to 
your play date.
-Put her on the phone. -The bathroom doesn't get 
---------------------------------------
reception.
Somehow I don't believe you.
And I'd like to say I'm glad about that.
But my poor sick sister asked for my assistance in the 
matter...
...so I'll leave it at this. She's not coming, don't try 
calling.
Humphrey, always a pleasure.
Gonna have to call you back. Beautiful day you're 
ruining, isn't it?
Do me a favor, please, and leave Serena alone.
It was Serena I was doing the favor for.
All I know is before spring break, everything was great, 
it was good.
Break's over, she's not quite herself. I think:
"What has changed in her life? Oh, the Bass family 
moved into it."
Dan, hi.
Hey.
-How are you feeling? -Good, my migraine's gone.
Migraine? I thought it was food poisoning.
Yeah, that came after.
-What happened last night? -I already told him.
I'm asking you.
Well, I got food poisoning and then Chuck helped me 
out.
Where did you eat that you got this killer food-poisoning 
migraine?
Drop the interrogation. Soon as you tell me where my 
girlfriend is.
---------------------------------------
I'm right here with you.
Look, I gotta go to class. I can't do this.
This is why I didn't want her to come back.
She's been back a day already and look what's 
happened.
If it's really that bad, why don't you just tell him about 
her?
I can't.
I'll see you later, okay?
Look, I'm not stupid.
You're not interested in how my family owns half of 
Tribeca.
We're interested. You're the newest member of our club.
Only for the smartest girls of the junior class.
Our junior class only has 30 girls. We're already an elite 
club.
Can I go now?
You know what'd be hot? You, us, at G Spot.
-Don't drink. -Saks Fifth?
-Hate shopping. -Yogurt?
Lactose intolerant. I don't want any friends.
All I want is to be alone and to never listen to Flo Rida 
ever again.
What happened? Backstage hit it and quit it?
What? No, my boyfriend broke up with me at a Flo Rida 
concert.
One minute we were waving our hands in the air... ...like 
we didn't care, and then next....
Since the Dalton guys were a bust, how about 
Collegiate?
---------------------------------------
The boys' lacrosse team is working out just around--
Jenny, look.
What did I tell you about that dog walker? There are no 
kings on Craigslist.
I don't think he's a walker. I think he's the owner.
I spy my king.
-Hi. How are you? -I'm good.
NELLY: Oh, God, not that song.
Nelly Yuki, what's wrong?
It's like it's happening all over again. That song reminds 
me of my boyfriend.
-My ex-boyfriend, I should say. -Oh, no.
Did he dump you? That's horrible.
What was his name? Brad? Bill?
Todd Jansen.
There is nothing like the fresh sharp pain of a breakup.
Believe me, I've had my fair share of heartache. This is 
about you.
Tonight, you're gonna come to my house, cry and get it 
all out of your system.
Can't. Have to be focused tomorrow.
You can't focus when something's on your mind, now, 
can you?
Come, come, come. Tell me all about it.
-I guess I'll just take the check. -Hold that, will you?
VANESSA: Daylight savings moved to March. Maybe no 
one told you.
I know I'm late.
-Coffee, Nate? -Yeah, thanks, Cora.
---------------------------------------
-You two know each other? -I've been here before.
You come all the way to Brooklyn for Greek food?
When I'm in Brooklyn, I like to come here, yes.
Because you're in Brooklyn all the time.
Well, my father's in rehab a couple blocks away, and....
Which, by the way, is why I'm late. I was-- Visiting 
hours.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--
No, I mean, it's not like it's some big secret.
It was on the front page of every newspaper in the city.
I guess it was, yeah.
Sometimes, after I'm done seeing him, I'm not ready to 
go see my mom yet...
...so I come here and I sit and just....
Think about how hard it is to know whose side you're 
supposed to be on?
Mom versus Dad, kid in the middle?
Confession:
I read one of your practice essays.
You left it in a book that you gave Dan.
And that's why I called you, to apologize.
Why?
Because I judged the cover, but now that I've read the 
book...
...I figured you were owed some apologetic souvlaki, at 
the very least.
Hey, Georgie, it was good to see you last night.
When are you going to Belgium?
Switzerland, and I'm supposed to leave tomorrow...
---------------------------------------
...but I'm not going till I make it up to you.
-Oh, nothing to make up. I had fun. -No, you didn't.
I mean, until after you left, I don't think I really heard what 
you were saying.
I didn't get it.
You've really changed.
-Yeah, I have. -I don't mean to sound corny.
-But it's a real inspiration to me. -Really?
I've always thought that I am who I'm going to be for the 
rest of my life.
And even those times when I maybe don't like myself...
...well, you can't decide to be somebody else.
-No, you can. -Yeah, listen, let's have dinner.
I mean, I wanna hear about your life...
...and if you can change, maybe there's hope for me too.
I have to study, I have SATs in the morning.
It'll just be an hour, we can time it. Promise.
The hardest drug on the table will be Perrier.
GOSSIP GIRL: Spotted, Serena van der Woodsen...
...being given a real-life multiple-choice question:
A, go home and study. B, get a good night's sleep.
C, call your boyfriend, or D....
-An hour. GOSSIP GIRL: None of the above.
-Good. -Hope that wasn't the wrong answer, S.
This test doesn't grade on a curve.
All right, "capacious" looks like "spacious." What does it 
mean? Roomy.
Yeah. "Captious."
---------------------------------------
Looks like....
Looks like "capacious."
I can't concentrate.
-Sound of your voice distracting you? -No.
It's Serena, actually. We had an argument.
RUFUS: I'm home. -Ooh!
Lookit, trig identities are memorized...
...my Latin is resurrected and my Lit paper's finished.
Impressive.
Seeing as you've returned the Valentino...
...and logged 10 hours of volunteer work at the shop--
-I'm not grounded anymore? -I have something for you.
No way.
It's not exactly the same as the one you pawned, but....
-Thank you. -No one's happier. You know...
...how much it costs to get a zipper repaired?
Since you'd be spending so much time at home....
-Wait, what? -So I guess you're still grounded.
-Dan. JENNY: Dad, wait.
I met this guy, I'm supposed to meet him tomorrow.
Grounded or not, you're not old enough to date.
-It's not a date, he's a friend. -Who's this guy?
-You don't know him. He goes to Unity. -Wait, Upper 
East Side Unity?
-Upper West Side. -How are you helping?
RUFUS: I thought you wanted a break from that crowd.
That made you feel like compromising character was a 
---------------------------------------
prerequisite to hang out.
So it's okay for Dan to date someone rich? It's not 
without its complications.
I thought you said it wasn't a date.
-It was nice there for a minute. -It was.
Hey, S, I'm just sipping a ginkgo biloba blended...
...and wondering how your stomach-migraine is.
Call me so I don't worry. How are you doing, Nelly Yuki?
NELLY: My upper trapezius seems to hold a lot of 
sadness.
Something tells me you'll be feeling better very soon.
-Any minute. -No, I think I should go home and study.
Mr. Jensen is here to see Miss Yuki.
Todd's here? [WHISPERS] Do I have cushion face?
A little.
-Hello, Todd. -Hi, Nelly.
-Blair said it was all right if I came. -For a Siberian 
ginseng pedi?
No.
I really feel bad about how things ended, Nell.
-So do I. -Can we talk about it in private?
Okay.
Thank you, B.
Lucky for us, mental acuity and common sense...
...rarely come in the same package.
Oxygen facials, anyone?
Next time your sister's band is in town, I want front row 
seats.
---------------------------------------
You don't strike me as a lesbian-punk fan.
I'm almost offended by how much you underestimate 
me, Miss Abrams.
You like punk?
Oh, I didn't hear-- You said punk? Because you had me 
at "lesbian."
Right. Didn't see that one coming.
-Hey, tell me something. -Yes?
Why do you do SAT practice tests if you're not planning 
on taking the exam?
To help Dan study.
I'm a filmmaker. Best education for me is making films.
Oh, I've never met anyone who felt college was optional.
My parents are artists, my sister's a musician.
Just like going to an Ivy is your family's way, not going 
to college is mine.
Think your parents wanna adopt a 17-year-old?
Maybe?
-So.... -So....
I guess this is good night, then.
-I don't live here, you know. -No, I know.
I'm just grabbing my laptop.
Do you wanna come inside?
God, this does feel like that doorstep moment.
And what moment would that be?
Yeah, that's the moment.
WOMAN: Can I get you two a cocktail?
Oh. I'm fine on my Diet Coke, thank you.
---------------------------------------
Um, yeah, me too. Thanks.
So tell me about Dan.
-I did. -Come on, his last name and zip code?
Scintillating details.
Come on, he's part of Serena, Second Edition.
Well....
I like the way I feel when he looks at me.
How?
Like....
Like I wanna believe in myself.
I know, you think it's a cliche.
No, no, sweetie, I think it's....
-It's incredible. -Yeah.
Look, I know I may not be your most trusted friend right 
now...
...but I think I know the old you pretty well.
Yeah, better than anyone, actually.
Well, from where I sit, it would take a lot to bring that 
person back.
I'm gonna call him, actually. He's nervous about 
tomorrow. I wanna wish him luck.
So I'll be back.
-That was quick. -Yeah, he didn't pick up.
-You can try him again later. -Yeah.
-Okay, I'd like to propose a toast. -Okay.
To the new you.
-To the new me. -Cheers.
You don't look so good. You okay, S?
---------------------------------------
No, I'm not okay.
How did we get here? What are we doing here?
Oh, my God, I'm supposed to be at Hunter College.
If memory serves, and it usually does, they don't let you 
in if you're late.
-Oh, my God. -I'm thinking eggs.
Do you want Florentine or Benedict?
-Wait, I was drinking soda, Georgie. -Yeah, until you 
switched to Patron.
Look, don't worry. I called Lily and covered your ass.
So you're welcome.
No, you knew I had SATs this morning.
Which is why I brought you here instead of home with 
one of your suitors.
I mean, the guy with the ironic mustache? You two took 
over the DJ booth.
Wait, a mustache? What are you talking about?
I guess you haven't changed as much as you thought.
Chuck?
Chuck, hey, I'm in trouble.
Look, I think I can still make it, but please go to Hunter...
...and try to keep the doors open until I get there.
Hey.
Last night was strange, but very fun.
Didn't we just say goodbye... -...five hours ago? -I'm 
taking you somewhere.
-I'm going to work. -Get someone to cover for you.
I can't jump in the car with you because you show up.
I'm not asking you to. This is a one-time offer, and 
---------------------------------------
there's a clock ticking.
But....
Fine. I am intrigued.
You wish your brother good luck today?
Yeah.
-May I be excused? -No, you may not.
We are not gonna walk around this house all day and not 
talk to each other.
Fine. You want me to speak? I'll speak.
You've entirely prejudged the Upper East Side.
-You shouldn't speak. -I learned my lesson on my 
birthday.
Asher's not like those girls, he's different. He's nice and 
polite and he likes animals.
Please let me go today?
So you didn't cancel?
I thought you'd change your mind.
I haven't.
VANESSA: Nate, I don't know about this.
I can't. I didn't even study.
You still made great scores on your practice tests.
VANESSA: That was for fun.
Listen, there's nothing wrong with keeping your options 
open.
I don't think your parents are gonna be mad at you for 
choosing your path.
Unless they're related to my parents.
Okay, right now, I'm going inside...
...and I'm not looking back or I might change my mind.
---------------------------------------
You're gonna do really well.
-Rough night? -Yeah, and not in a good way.
-Todd doesn't wanna get back together. -Oh, no? But 
he said--
We stayed up...
...having the same conversation about why we broke up 
over and over again.
-Unbelievable. I'm so sorry. ISABEL: I don't believe it, 
it's crazy.
I got no sleep. Spent the whole night crying.
Okay, well, good luck.
Do you really think this is going to work? Yes, but I also 
believe in insurance.
From her calculator.
You never did tell us how you got Todd to play along.
Isabel, what are you doing later tonight?
Not Todd.
Okay, well, I guess I'm gonna have to come up with 
something else.
-Dan, where's Serena? -I don't know, but I bet Chuck 
does.
-Ugh. Well, I'll try to save a seat for her. -Yeah, I'll keep 
calling.
Hey, Serena, it's me.
A very worried me concerned about the very missing you.
Hi, I'm Serena van der Woodsen.
-How'd you do? -Not my finest hour.
I finished, but kind of had a lot on my mind.
-I'll keep calling. -Yeah, I think I know where to find her.
Hey, S, it's B. Now I'm really worried.
---------------------------------------
I'm gonna go home and change and then....
VANESSA: Thank you.
Call me. Bye.
-Hey. -Hey.
Hey.
What's going on?
Nothing, I'm fine.
No, you're not, and you need to stop saying that. Hey.
-Where were you? -She was with me.
What he means is, we were both at home. My stomach 
started acting up again.
Okay, a food poisoning relapse?
-If you didn't study enough and freaked-- -I told you, I 
was sick.
You paid someone else to take the SAT for you and that's 
the best you can do?
-What are you talking about? -The 5-foot-nothing 
redhead...
...claiming to be Serena van der Woodsen. That wasn't 
you.
SERENA: What'd you do? I told you to keep the doors 
open.
-When I got there, they were closed. -Yeah, they don't 
keep the doors open.
I was thinking on my feet. Just trying to help.
I'm not mad, okay? I'm just worried. I've been so worried 
about you.
Please, help me understand what's going on here.
Can we talk tomorrow? I'll call you.
I'm sorry.
---------------------------------------
I'm sorry too.
-Chuck, you went too far. -And so did you, sis.
Look, I feel foolish admitting it, but obviously I've come 
late to this party.
-English, please. -What's Georgina got on you?
-Chuck. -Dan, I understand.
But what's so bad you can't even tell me?
Oh. Hi, sweetie, let me just call some room-- I don't 
want you to ever contact me again.
Just because of a few nights of fun?
It wasn't fun waking up and not knowing where I was.
It wasn't fun missing the SATs, and it definitely wasn't 
fun lying to Dan.
And this is all my fault because...?
My fault, because I make huge mistakes when I'm with 
you.
So you wanna distance yourself from your mistakes by 
staying away from me.
You were there too, Serena.
It was just as much you, if not more--
This is not about last year, it's about last night.
Like you were some innocent bystander who walked in 
on--
I'm not talking about it, Georgina, okay?
And neither are you.
If I go down, you go down with me.
In the meantime, stay out of my life.
I don't need anybody in my life who doesn't wanna be 
there.
Then we're agreed.
---------------------------------------
You must be the Unity boy.
Hopefully there's not another one on his way.
The name's Asher, and I do go to Unity.
Hi.
JENNY: Asher?
-What are you doing here? -I was just gonna ask the 
same thing.
Since you couldn't come to the hot dogs, I'm bringing 
them to you.
Sorry to surprise you, sir.
That's so sweet.
Especially since my unreasonable father has grounded 
me for life.
-I'm standing right here. -I wish more of my friends' 
parents...
...cared enough to ground them when they messed up.
Looks like our queen wannabe found her perfect king.
Well, since you're here with a year's supply of hot dogs...
...maybe you'd like to come in.
We hear he's a Unity man.
Guess big brother's been teaching little sis... ...how to 
snag the ones with the trust funds.
Hi.
-Hey, buddy, there you go. -Oh.
Georgie, hey. Bad boy.
-I'm sorry he disturbed you. -It's fine. I love dogs.
Really? Do you have any?
No, we used to have a cat, but, you know, sister, 
allergies.
---------------------------------------
Now the cat, Iggy, lives in Florida with my grandma.
Doesn't write, never calls.
-I'm sorry to hear that. -It's just a cat.
-I'm Sarah, by the way. -I'm Dan. Nice to meet you, 
Sarah.
End

WOMAN: Where has she been?
GOSSIP GIRL: And who am I?
That's one secret I'll ever tell.
You know you love me. XOXO...
...Gossip Girl.
Spotted, Jenny Humphrey wading in the Met fountain, 
fishing for change.
Blair Waldorf seen dallying with an off-duty doorman...
...at the Blarney Stone on a Monday night.
It looks like the battle between the Queen B and Little J...
...has moved from the streets to the blogs.
Who's sending this debasing dish?
I have a feeling.
A nice, shiny dime to add to your collection.
Why the fruit cup, B? Lost your taste for yogurt?
So, what are we doing tonight?
Asher's parents are in Cannes so he and Jenny are 
throwing a party at his house.
It's a really small get-together with just our closest 
friends.
-Sorry. -Blair can take my place.
Invitations are nontransferable. She's new to the group.
---------------------------------------
Just because your name is on the invite doesn't make 
you a hostess.
Oh. Then why is the party planner calling me? Excuse 
me, girls.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Dad, I'm kind of busy. What's up?
I was just wondering what time you want me to serve...
...your favorite meal tonight, maybe around 8?
Oh, um, I have that choir thing.
I talked to you about it and you said I could go.
Oh, right, well, maybe we could wait to eat till after you 
got home, then.
-You're gonna be hungry after singing. -They have food 
there.
And it's probably gonna go pretty late. So tomorrow? 
Okay, love you.
Love you too.
Sorry, floral emergency.
Oh, and you will be happy to know that the entire Unity 
Lacrosse Team RSVP'd.
HAZEL: Oh, my God, it's Asher. PENELOPE: Let's go say 
hi.
How did little Jenny Humphrey become the next Brooke 
Astor?
-The same way they all do. -Marry up.
SERENA: Hey, why the long face?
Are you still sad Mom wouldn't let you go to Monte Carlo 
for the bachelor party?
No, I'm fine. I figured I'd let Bart, Chuck and Prince Albert 
have their fun.
Oh, that didn't come out like I meant it.
---------------------------------------
Gossip Girl.
Jenny's been spotted at GAP sewing Stella McCartney 
labels into pocket tees.
-These are getting ridiculous. -Like the one where I'm 
Gossip Girl.
Hey, it made sense at the time.
-You have to admit. It did. -It never made sense.
Yeah, it did. Wait, hold on, it's Chuck.
I have something to do, but tell him I say hi.
-Okay, don't forget about dinner tonight. -Yeah.
Salut, Chuck. Yes, I'm still fine.
I haven't heard from Georgina in two weeks.
So if you'd stop calling me, I'd finally be rid of all of my 
monsters.
Bye.
You can read about it all day long, but you have to walk 
the city to know it.
Okay, but anything is better than getting lost on the train 
every day.
Subway. Click those heels all you want. You're not in 
Portland anymore.
Seriously, you and Dan are so sweet to adopt me.
I'd be a mess without you guys. Well, more of a mess 
than I already am.
-Red eye to go? -Yes, please, thank you.
Hey, Sarah. Sorry for talking your ear off the other night.
-He rambles, as you'll get to know. -Yeah.
Well, I'm a good listener, as he'll get to know.
-Are there any new developments? -No. No more of the 
same.
Jenny and her boyfriend are still inseparable, she's even 
---------------------------------------
more insufferable.
Give her a break. Asher's her first love.
It's infatuation, it's not love.
Yeah, but to a 15-year-old girl, I mean, there really isn't 
a difference.
And how long did it take you, Dan?
That's a little different, Vanessa. It took me....
-One look at a ninth-grade birthday party? -Yes, but two 
years to obsess over it.
So things are better with Serena?
Serena. Yeah, yeah. Good memory. Things are finally 
back to normal.
Good.
Well, I mean, you know, it's tough making friends in a 
new city.
It'd be really nice to meet her.
Yeah, Serena would love you. She loves everybody.
Not that she would only like you because she doesn't 
discriminate.
See what she meant about that rambling thing?
-How's tonight? -Tonight would be perfect.
Good. See you.
WOMAN 1: Are you serious? WOMAN 2: Yeah, totally.
He's so cute.
-Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? -Sure. Is something 
wrong?
That's what I was gonna ask you. Where have you been?
-You haven't returned any of my calls. -Sorry.
Been hard to keep up with schoolwork...
---------------------------------------
...and the new spring social calendar and my boyfriend.
Yeah. Asher, right?
Yeah, he's cute and smart and basically perfect.
And the best part is, he really likes me.
Well, then he has good taste. But how well do you 
actually know him?
That's sweet. You're being protective.
No, I'm not. Yes. Yes, I am.
I mean nothing against him.
Something about him makes me feel he's not the right 
guy.
Oh, my God, wait. Do you have a crush on me or 
something?
-No, I don't. I just want you-- -Don't be embarrassed. 
It's cute.
I mean, and not so unexpected, actually. I'm flattered, 
it's just....
My heart belongs to Asher.
I actually gotta go, but text me, okay?
What, you're here. And you're late.
I know. I come bearing apologies and an invitation.
-What are you up to tonight? -I know what I'm not up 
to, having fun.
The SAT tutor was over for four hours last night.
So this tutor, is he cute?
If hair in the ears is your thing.
I hate that since I'm not gonna use the score Chuck 
bought for me...
...I have to study every night.
I can't even be distracted by that.
---------------------------------------
That.
I see your point. So then how about dinner tonight with 
Sarah instead?
Sarah again? Is she your new girlfriend or something?
Yeah. Just kidding. But she's new in town and she wants 
to meet you.
Since Bart and Chuck are out of town...
...I already agreed to a quiet family dinner in our old 
suite. I'm sorry.
-What about tomorrow? -No, my sister and tongue.
The two things that don't go together so well.
Lighten up. You've been down on him since the 
beginning.
Give him a chance and then judge. Maybe he'll surprise 
you, like I did.
-How are you always so right? -It's easy when you're 
always wrong.
Hey, you have first period free. Go get to know him.
-Go. -Okay, all right, okay.
GOSSIP GIRL: Sometimes, in an effort to spread the 
most outrageous rumors...
...we look over the very thing that's even more 
scandalous.
The truth.
And the only thing more shocking than the truth...
...are the lies people tell to cover it up.
When you revise the seating chart, don't forget to place 
Mr. Spitzer...
...as far away from Serena's table as possible.
Thank you.
-What is not on the schedule today? RUFUS: I don't think 
---------------------------------------
I am.
Maybe you can fit me in between Preston Bailey and 
Sylvia Weinstock?
Good luck fitting anything between those two.
-What are you doing here? -Well, I'm here to see you.
Well, I have a laundry list of things to do today.
It's about Jenny. Alison's away on an artists' retreat...
...and I could really use a mother's advice. I think I might 
be in over my head.
I suppose we could talk about it on the way.
RUFUS: Thank you.
MAN: Hey. -What's going on?
Asher, how's it going? Got a minute?
Yeah, but just a minute. Jenny and I have a lunch date.
Well, look, there's no easy way to say this, honestly, so 
I'm just gonna....
I'm just gonna say it. I saw you this morning.
-Saw me what? -I saw you....
-You know, I saw you kissing that guy. -You got the 
wrong person.
Come on, man, I don't think I do.
Are you calling me queer?
-That's not at all what I said. -You wanna know how 
queer I am?
I'm so queer I'm gonna pop your sister's cherry tonight.
Hey, what'd you say?
-What are you doing? Stop. -I need to talk to you.
Anything you have to say, say in front of my boyfriend.
Okay, fine. Your boyfriend is not being honest with you.
---------------------------------------
I wasn't gonna tell you yet.
But I wanted to invite you to the country house this 
weekend.
Your brother thought we were moving fast and got upset.
-Can't you let me be happy for once? -I want you to be 
happy. Just not--
I understand you're threatened by him because he's 
everything you wanna be.
He's good-looking and worldly, a legacy at Dartmouth.
But even you should know that jealousy clashes with 
L.L.Bean pants.
SERENA: It's a snub from one party, B.
What's the big deal? You don't even like Asher.
I didn't like last season's Louis Vuitton patchwork bag...
...but that doesn't mean I wanna see it on Jenny 
Humphrey's arm.
Touche.
Girls' night out tonight?
I can't, I have dinner with the family.
Let me remind you of a little promise you made.
"Don't go to France. I'll be there for you."
I'm sorry I've been distant, but things will be better soon.
Obviously starting tomorrow.
-Hey. -Hey.
What's wrong? You look stressed, even for you.
I'm still worried about Jenny.
Because she's self-obsessed, self-serving, selfcentered, self--
No, I wish it was about her and herself, but it's more 
about who she's with.
---------------------------------------
I can't get through to her. I tried.
And she just completely blew me off and she dissed my 
pants.
Maybe I underestimated her.
She's going through a phase. We all went through it.
And apparently, some of us still are in it.
All that matters to someone like Jenny now are the four 
G's:
-Guys, girlfriends and Gossip Girl. -It's true. Don't feel 
bad.
Unless it's coming from one of them, she's not gonna 
hear it.
MAN: Here we go. RUFUS: Thank you.
I tell her she can't see Asher. She calls him.
I take away her phone, they're on iChat.
How do you keep them from growing up...
...when they can have a relationship from their own 
bedrooms?
Well, the answer is you can't. She's gonna grow up no 
matter what.
I read her e-mail.
You can't be too concerned about their privacy when 
their well-being is at stake.
Especially if you think they're lying to you. Was she?
Right to my face. I know Serena went through a similar 
phase.
Well, if Serena's indiscretions were as PG as Jenny's...
...I wouldn't have needed the BOTOX.
-Dan was so much easier. -Well, raising girls is 
different.
Serena would be a horrible monster for a hundred days...
---------------------------------------
...and then on the hundred and first, she'd be my little 
girl again.
-So I just wait and hope? -Well, that's the hardest part.
You have to trust that you've done your job.
She'll come back to you.
-That's.... -It's perfect.
It's beautiful. It's my finest piece.
Here.
Let me.
Mark Ingram, it's beautiful.
You've outdone yourself.
This just in.
Asher Hornsby spotted locking lips before class, but not 
with his girlfriend.
Looks like gentlemen don't prefer blondes, Little J.
They prefer other gentlemen.
Now you know how Vanessa Hudgens feels.
Is this just another round of blanks fired between B and 
Little J?
I'm tired of being the bearer of bad grudges.
This is the last item that goes to press without proof.
I'm glad Gossip Girl got her balls back.
Yeah, she was totally turning into the new page 6.
-Low blow. -Wasn't me. Wish it was.
Hello?
Miss van der Woodsen? It's Luke from the concierge 
desk.
You asked us to call first before delivering anything 
upstairs.
---------------------------------------
-Is there something for me? -A package from a Miss 
Georgina Sparks.
Hello? Did I lose you?
Uh.... No, just keep it there. I'll pick it up right after 
school.
-Don't let it out of your sight. -Of course.
-Thank you. -What was that about?
Nothing, it's just this-- Nothing. I'll see you later, okay? 
Bye.
-Bye. Hey. SERENA: Hey, B.
Dan Humphrey. Just who I hate to admit I was looking 
for.
-You're dirty. -What you talking about?
Cheating, drinking, drugs, all fair game. But outing your 
sister's boyfriend is dark.
How did squeaky-clean Humphrey come up with that?
I didn't come up with anything.
Oh, my God. You know something. Spill it.
Yeah, I might have seen Asher kissing another guy.
So it's true? Who was he kissing?
I don't know, I couldn't see. What does that matter?
Now Gossip Girl's credibility is the same as Tinsely 
Mortimer's after a few martinis.
But if I can prove his duplicity is more than just a rumor, 
then they'll break up.
-That's what you want, isn't it? -Yeah, I guess.
Asher's just using your sister as a cover.
It's your brotherly duty to save her from becoming the 
next Katie Holmes.
You're in this to help Jenny?
---------------------------------------
Motive is irrelevant as long as our endgame is the same.
No, this is not a game to me. I don't want her to get hurt.
Should've thought about that before you told Manhattan 
Jenny's a glorified hag.
You know what? You're on your own.
I'm done.
Suit yourself.
LILY: Really, Rufus, what were you thinking?
You threw her a surprise birthday party...
...and had her face painted on a cake with a tiara?
Seemed like a good idea at the time. LILY: So did flannel 
and acid-washed jeans.
But they weren't flattering either.
What is it? Is it too much?
Uh, is it not enough?
It's not the dress. It's you in it.
I'm sorry, I thought....
I didn't mean....
We're here as friends, right?
No, we are friends.
It's just how you look.
Nothing new on Gossip Girl for three hours.
Guess she wasn't kidding about her new standard.
Jenny, sorry, I can't chat, but have fun at your party 
tonight.
She's totally running to a booty call with your brother.
-I cannot believe you just went there. -And where have 
you gone, Little J.?
---------------------------------------
-Yeah, you and Asher. How far? -Far enough.
-Playing coy only means one thing. -Maybe Asher 
doesn't like girls.
-Is that why we went to third? -You went to third?
No, he did.
Well done. Make him work for it.
Whoever said that money doesn't buy happiness didn't 
know where to shop.
Lucky for me, I may have to go out tonight after all. Did 
you get it?
Lucky for you, Is knows five ways to sneak into the Unity 
boys' locker room...
...and six to sneak out.
Asher takes an abnormally long shower after practice.
Maybe his Lacrosse stick isn't the only thing he likes to 
play with.
Why'd you want his phone so badly?
It was once said that a person's eyes are the windows 
to their soul.
That was before people had cell phones.
Hey.
This is a surprise. Party's not for a couple hours.
Yeah, well, a lot can happen in a couple hours.
Jenny. What are you doing?
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong. This-- It just isn't what we do.
Are you suddenly not happy?
-I'm holding up my end of the bargain. -What bargain?
You're Jenny Humphrey from Brooklyn.
---------------------------------------
You need status, access, resources, I give that to you.
-What do I give you? -Do we really need to talk about 
this?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we do.
So, what was on Gossip Girl's true?
Do you really think someone like me would just date 
someone like you?
-You've been so nice. -And I'll keep being nice.
Nothing has to change, okay?
-Asher.... -Come on, Jenny.
Tonight, you're hosting your first Upper East Side party.
That's something that Blair and those girls can never take 
away from you.
-I know. Thank you. -You're welcome.
And there is something you can do to show your thanks.
I think it would be better for both of us...
...if we put those rumors to rest once and for all.
What do you want me to do?
GEORGINA [ON VIDEO]: If you put the camera over 
there, she'll never know.
MAN: Are you sure she's gonna be down for this?
GEORGINA: It's Serena. She goes down for anything.
Hey, baby, how are the new Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd?
SERENA: I just did something so stupid.
SERENA: It's hot, okay? I'm too hot. MAN: You are too 
hot.
-Where do you think you're going? -I can't talk, I'll 
explain later.
If you invite an friend to our quiet family dinner, I expect 
you to stay and eat.
---------------------------------------
You know how I always loved when Georgina came 
around.
I ran into Lily in the lobby.
You totally forgot to tell her I was coming over for dinner.
Did you get my present?
Breaking news:
Asher Hornsby overheard bragging...
...that Little J. swiped her V card at his register.
Jenny, is this true?
It's private.
-It's on the Internet. -Well, it's none of your business.
Since when did you start reading Gossip Girl blasts?
Since you became the subject of them.
You're 15 years old and I'm your big brother. It is my 
business.
Well, it's not true. You happy?
You can't tell anyone, though. Everyone has to believe 
it.
You want your friends to think you're sleeping with a guy 
who's gay?
-Do you believe everything on Gossip Girl? -I didn't read 
it, I saw it.
You were the one who sent the tip?
Yeah, look, I'm sorry, but I tried to tell you.
You wouldn't listen to me. I needed to get your attention 
somehow.
Well, I knew about him the whole time.
So you let him use you?
Well, maybe I was using him. Did you ever think of that?
---------------------------------------
I don't know which is worse.
For once in your life, could you stop judging everyone?
-I'm not. -You think you're so different and good?
Well, guess what, Dan?
The minute you start sending tips to Gossip Girl, you're 
in the game.
-Get out of my room. -Hey.
-B, now's not a good time. -It's important.
Look, I know I told you I'd be more available, but I just 
can't right now.
But it can't wait.
-Sorry, it was just Blair. -Oh, how is Snow White?
Snow not so white. Did you hear she--?
-Eric. -What?
So, Georgina, what brings you back to New York?
-I just had some time to kill. -Went to boarding school 
in Switzerland.
Your parents must be happy you're back.
Oh, no. Actually, they've moved to the country full-time.
I'm just in the city to catch up with some old friends.
What about you?
You and that gorgeous Tiffany rock seem to be the talk 
of the city.
Thank you. Mr. Bass and I are very happy.
You look it. You all do.
I mean, there must be love in the New York air.
You're engaged, Serena's found a new guy, Eric found 
himself a boyfriend.
Excuse me?
---------------------------------------
I'm sorry. I don't think I heard you right.
-You haven't met Serena's new guy? LILY: A boyfriend?
Oh, you mean Eric.
You didn't know he was dating someone?
I didn't think it was a secret.
I saw them kissing in front of St. Jude's this morning for 
all the world to see.
Well, don't look so embarrassed, E. He is a hot piece.
-Well done. -Please, Georgina, it's not funny, okay?
Oh, I'm....
You didn't know Eric was dating a boy?
This doesn't make any sense because that would mean 
that Eric is....
And he's not.
He's just not.
Are you?
Oh, God.
SERENA: Eric.
Great, Mom. That's just great.
How dare you?
Dan went out and I'm going to choir practice.
Don't wait up.
Not so fast.
Where were you gonna change your clothes?
We don't wear a uniform for rehearsal.
Well, unless the choir is entertainment at Asher's party...
...you have some explaining to do.
---------------------------------------
How'd you know about the party?
I know a lot more than you think I do.
Nice dress.
I wanted one night out. What was I supposed to do?
-Ask my permission. -You'd say no.
You're probably right, but that's no excuse to lie to me.
Dad, you don't understand. I'm throwing this party.
Not anymore. Tell Asher you're not coming.
I can't, it's too late. All my friends--
-You heard me. -I promised.
All that good behavior from the past few weeks just got 
wiped out from that lie.
-You can't stop me, I'm going. -Jenny, if you walk out 
that door, I--
You'll what? What, Dad? What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna put bars on my window or chain me to 
the kitchen counter?
I'm not your--
I'm not a little girl anymore.
You can't make me do anything.
You've already lost my trust.
You really wanna lose my respect too?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, okay.
-Hey, it's me. -Bye.
Who are you talking to?
Chuck.
What, you called Chuck?
---------------------------------------
Yeah, I've been talking to him a lot lately.
Guy's got his faults, but he's never judged me.
I'm your sister. We're us.
You can tell me anything.
I wanted to.
But it's not the type of thing you blurt out on the way to 
school.
I was waiting for the right time.
Dinner with Georgina definitely wasn't that, huh?
I'm sorry about her.
About me.
I came back for you and then I abandoned you all over 
again.
This isn't like before.
I'm fine, really.
Well, I'm here now.
When I was at Ostroff, I met this guy.
We were going through the same stuff and now that guy 
is dating Jenny.
Wait, you're the mystery guy that Asher was spotted 
kissing?
I know this isn't how you wanted this to happen.
Yeah, I guess the important thing is that it's happening.
I'm so proud of you.
I love you.
No matter what you do, who you like...
...whose boyfriend kisses you.
The people who care about you will always stand by your 
side, okay?
---------------------------------------
Yeah, I think I'm gonna drop by Asher's party.
There's one more person I have to talk to.
Oh, my God, Blair crashed Jenny's party.
You look....
-I know. -Jenny's gonna freak.
Watch and learn, ladies.
The most important parties to attend are the ones you're 
not invited to.
Where's the host? I have something for him.
Thank God you're here. I'm so happy to see you.
Hey, I'm happy to see you too. You can meet Sarah.
I'd love to, but now is not a good time.
Well, she's here, so, Sarah, Serena. Serena, Sarah.
Hi, I'm Sarah. It is so nice to finally meet you.
Thanks.
Wow, I mean....
Dan told me you're pretty, but he didn't do you justice.
-Dan, can we talk in private, please? -Hey, no, no, no. 
Wait. Don't go.
Vanessa was about to show me one of her movies.
I'm a filmmaker too, of sorts. Actually, I brought one of 
my short films.
I was hoping to get your opinion.
Maybe you wanna see it too? Tell me what you think?
I'll go get my laptop.
Dan, would you get me a coffee?
-Please? -Yeah.
What are you doing, Georgina? Put that away.
---------------------------------------
Come on, I'm just having a little fun.
Like old times. You and me pretending to be different 
people.
-Svetlana and Savannah. -This is not a game.
I don't know how you filmed that, but I'm not playing with 
you.
It's just a friendly game.
-But we're not friends. -Oh, I think we are.
You see, because with me as your enemy, Dan sees this.
And if the heavy petting doesn't send him running...
...well, I'll bet what happened after will.
-Hey, what'd we miss? -Nothing.
It's like Sarah and I have known each other for years.
-Oh, great. -We don't need the laptop. Thanks.
No, I got a little shy about showing it. Maybe next time?
Okay.
Was it as special as you hoped it would be?
-Because yours totally wasn't. -And yours was?
MAN: Ladies, your drinks. JENNY: I mean, yeah.
-Asher made me feel really safe. -You are so lucky.
-I know. -You guys, Blair is here.
What is she doing here? She wasn't invited.
We need to talk.
-Give us a moment, guys. -I thought you might want this 
back.
Whatever you found, it's not what it looks like.
It's what it looks like, and judging by the texts and 
photos...
---------------------------------------
...looks like more than friendship.
-What are you gonna do with them? -Your friend is 
someone I care about.
Or I would've used them against you and Jenny.
-Too bad you don't care about him. -It's okay, Blair. I 
can handle this.
-What's he doing here? -What is she doing here?
-Gonna tell her or am I? -There's nothing to tell.
Gossip Girl was right.
Asher was kissing someone this morning. Me.
He's totally lying. Tell him, Jenny. I was with you all 
morning.
Yeah, Asher's right.
I was with him. Eric's lying.
Why would I stand here in front of everyone we know...
...and tell them if it wasn't true?
I'm gay. And so are you.
Get this faggot out of here.
Go ahead and do it.
What did you just do?
BLAIR: You'll see.
What kind of mother does not know that her son is gay?
The people you know best are the ones most capable of 
surprising you.
The things that I said, the way I acted....
It was not my finest maternal moment.
What if he does something again?
I know how much you love him, so does he.
---------------------------------------
-You just need to remind him of that. -But what if it's 
not enough?
-Most of the time, it's all we've got. -And what about 
you?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna wait for my daughter to come to me.
And then I'm gonna ground her until she's 25.
We make quite the team.
Always did.
Good luck, Lil, with everything.
I'm sure you'll make a beautiful bride.
Thank you.
Good night, Rufus.
Weekend update:
A same-sex kiss hasn't caused this much controversy...
...since Britney and Madonna.
Looks like Little J didn't spread her legs after all.
She spread lies instead.
Asher is gay and I have the correspondence to prove it.
Looks like someone needs a semester in France.
PENELOPE: Get your things, we're leaving. -We can still 
have fun. Don't leave.
It's kind of hard to party after the gay bomb drops.
I'm gonna do something out of character and give you 
the benefit of the doubt.
Tell us Gossip Girl is wrong.
Did you or did you not sleep with Asher?
I may have exaggerated a little bit.
---------------------------------------
Dating a gay guy is an honest mistake.
But lying to your girlfriends about sex is unforgivable.
To think I almost asked you to wear a matching dress 
tonight.
-You're branded now with the L word. -Liar.
So, what are we doing tonight?
We are doing nothing.
I, however, am going home.
But tomorrow, dinner at the Waverly and then to 151 for 
drinks.
-Yeah. -I'll have Dorota... ...BlackBerry everyone an 
itinerary.
Don't look so sad, Little J. The sun will come out 
tomorrow.
Even though your boyfriend did today.
Hey, I made some tea.
It's probably iced now, but, um.... Look, my reaction 
earlier--
-It's okay, Mom. -No, it's not okay.
You just caught me off-guard, I guess I....
I just wasn't ready.
Well, I wasn't ready either so....
It's okay if you need time.
Well, since you're being so honest...
...I'm gonna try as well, okay?
I'm scared.
And life is tough enough as it is, you know?
I want the best for you.
And I'm worried for your safety and your happiness.
---------------------------------------
I have a better chance of being happy if I'm honest.
I know that.
And I want you to know what love is whoever you're with.
Because it's pretty great.
You would know, right? Fourth time's the charm.
Yeah.
Ah, yes, the truth always comes out.
It's one of the fundamental rules of time.
And when it comes out, it can set you free.
Or end everything you fought so hard for.
My, my.
If it isn't Little J risen from the ashes.
I came to tell you in person. You win.
Oh, sweetie. We just started to play.
No, you don't understand.
I'm done.
With you, with them, with all of it.
Just like that, you wave the white flag?
I lied and I stole and I lost the respect of my family for 
what?
So I can be like you?
You asked me before if it was all worth it.
My answer is, it's not.
I tried to warn you.
There's a price to pay.
I always knew a girl like you couldn't afford it.
Well, you were right.
---------------------------------------
Well, you put up a good fight. For a freshman.
Thanks.
Hope you don't expect a hug.
I don't expect anything anymore.
So? She's great, right? What do you think?
Honestly, there's something I don't like about her.
Okay, but you had your doubts about Vanessa and now 
you are friends.
This is different.
-I don't understand why you're-- -Why I'm what?
Jealous. There's no reason to be. She actually wanted 
us to patch things up.
-You told her about our problems? -Yes, she wanted to 
listen to them.
-And she had good advice too. -Look at me.
I love you, okay?
You just have to take my word for it.
Do not trust her.
But you just met her.
You've been hanging out with Chuck and you've been 
partying and avoiding me...
...and lying and you tell me who I can and cannot trust?
I don't understand that at all.
You know, we all live in Brooklyn.
So I don't know, if you need to catch a cab, I think you 
should do that here.
Dan, don't. I wanna talk.
Then talk.
VANESSA: I'm gonna get going. -Hey, just hold on. One 
---------------------------------------
second.
I forgot something inside. I'll catch up with you guys?
Okay?
-Well, I had fun. How about you? -What do you want 
from me?
I want things to go back to how they were, before that 
night.
Before things got so screwed up.
We were such good friends.
And now we can be again.
Why would I wanna be friends with somebody who 
blackmails me...
...who outs my little brother at the dinner table?
Eric was an honest mistake. I would never hurt him.
No, I don't believe you. I don't believe you about Eric, 
about anything.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I did it on purpose.
Because I can. Because I know things.
About you, about your family.
About your boyfriend.
And I know them before you do.
Oh, look, cab.
You get home safe.
Hold up, guys, I'm coming.
Another way the truth comes out when you don't even 
mean it to.
"Angry."
"Change."
---------------------------------------
"Trust."
"Girl."
Something you wanna talk about?
Who would've thought Scrabble could be therapeutic?
That last one was a triple word score.
Or when, without saying a word, it's still loud and clear.
Dad?
Do you think it'd be okay if I joined you?
You know there's always room for you here.
Yeah, and Dad's totally losing so he could use your help.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about everything.
But the worst thing the truth can do is when you finally 
tell it...
...it doesn't set you free, but locks you away forever.
SERENA: Blair?
Serena, what are you doing here? It's late.
Oh, my God.
What happened? What's wrong?
-Talk to me. -I can't.
-Of course you can. -No.
No, B, this is the one thing I can't tell you. I can't tell 
anyone.
I'm not anyone, I'm me. You can tell me anything.
No, I can't, because then, that'd make you a part of it.
And you can't be a part of this.
What are you talking about? You're starting to scare me.
---------------------------------------
Hey, hey, hey. We're sisters.
You're my family. What is you is me.
There's nothing that you could ever say to make me let 
go.
I love you.
What is it?
I killed someone.
End

GOSSIP GIRL: Where has she been?
And who am I?
That's one secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me. XOXO...
...Gossip Girl.
In our modern age...
...when you call someone and can't find them...
...you can pretty much be sure they'll get the message.
Hey, S, it's Georgie.
Listen, I know it's early, but I thought I'd....
So this is my third call. Where are you?
It's me again.
I've left you a couple messages, and you haven't called 
me back.
I think we should hang out today. Friends hang out.
Maybe you've lost your cell phone.
Can't wait to see you.
GOSSIP GIRL: But if they don't call you back...
...it usually means they don't wanna be found.
Hey, do you think "Track Me Down" should come before 
or after "Every Time"?
---------------------------------------
Is the Rolling Stone thing tonight?
I'm in the "Top 10 Forgotten Bands of the '90s."
-It's true, I forgot. -Yeah, but a lot of people remember.
There's a reason that issue was one of the highest selling 
of the year.
Then I'm proud. Dad, I really am.
You got a follow-up article and a concert, surely 
followed by an overpriced CD...
...sold at corporate coffeehouses for Gen X'ers without 
taste buds or taste.
Hey, it's gonna to be cool. They're even filming it for 
VH1.
VH1 Classics. The classic is kind of important.
-I'm classic. -Heh.
Uh-oh. No retort.
Signs of a sleepless night.
Disinterest in making your father feel old and irrelevant.
It can only mean one thing, girl trouble.
Yeah, Serena and I--
We had a fight last night, this new kind that we keep 
having.
Where she says something, and it's not the truth.
Have you asked her what's really on her mind?
-Only about 10,000 times. -But did you really mean it?
When people don't offer truth, they're afraid of what 
someone might think.
I don't know if you know this, but you can be a pretty 
judgmental guy.
I should learn to be someone else around her so she can 
be herself around me?
---------------------------------------
I couldn't have said it better myself.
Thank you, Dad.
I'm gonna go find her right now.
See you tonight.
Both of you.
And here I thought I had your schedule memorized.
I switched shifts and just got off.
I'm Dan's dad's roadie for the day, so I gotta be on, like, 
5.
Although I don't mind the stalking, when you gonna ask 
me on a real date?
Uh.... Hold that thought, sorry.
Hello.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Look, I'm sorry, I gotta go.
-So I heard. -No, it's not what you think, it's just--
What are you doing tonight?
Me, Lincoln Hawk, a dirty van and a lot of cables.
-Can I meet you at the concert? -Can you be there at 
7:30?
-It's a date. -Finally.
Text me the address.
MAN: The guests will be checked into the suites as soon 
as they arrive.
The walkthrough is at 2:00...
...and the rehearsal dinner starts promptly at 7 p.m. in 
the Reid Salon.
Don't forget, you have an interview with Rolling Stone in 
---------------------------------------
one hour.
The interview. How could we forget?
Hey, excuse me, Mr. Bass, Miss van der Woodsen.
Not for long, thank you.
-Good morning, Daniel. -Good morning.
Have either of you seen Serena? She's not upstairs. Uhhuh. Tick-tock, tick-tock. Tick-tock, tick-tock. Hmm?
LILY: No, Dan, sorry.
Okay.
And her bed doesn't look slept in.
Well, I knew housekeeping was hiring, but had no idea 
their standards were low.
I hate to ask you this, but have you seen Serena?
Oh, I've seen lots of Serena.
Are you drunk dialing again?
No, Serena didn't come home last night.
I thought she was with you.
Hey.
Maybe this is Blair's idea of a perverse double date?
Miss Blair asks that you should wait here.
-She's on her way now. -She's not even here?
Well, this ought to be good.
You're not calling me back, and you're not picking up.
I thought you understood me.
But maybe I should make myself a little more clear and 
come to you.
We can talk about it over coffee.
I brought it just way you like it.
---------------------------------------
Dark, but sweet.
Oh, no.
Hey, Sarah.
-Ha-ha. Dan. -Hey.
Oh, my gosh, what a coincidence.
-Yeah, what are you doing here? -Oh.
-I have a friend from Portland here. -Oh, okay.
-What are you doing here? -I just came looking for 
Serena.
But she apparently didn't come home, so I'm just trying 
to figure out what to think.
She's been--
Let's say she's not been herself lately, so I don't know 
what to do exactly.
Why don't you try giving her a call again?
And when she sees it's you calling...
...she'll immediately pick up and tell you all about it.
Hey.
-Hey, I was looking all over for you. MAN [OVER 
PHONE]: Hey, is this Dan?
-Who's this? -My name's Drew, the bartender at 1-0.
Some girl left her phone last night. It's been ringing all 
morning.
-You're the first number on the speed dial. -Some girl, 
what girl?
Tall, blonde, left here around 2 with three guys.
Skipped out on her tab which was pretty....
Hey, what is it?
GOSSIP GIRL: Spotted.
---------------------------------------
Lonely Boy on the Upper East Side...
...learning the lesson that nothing stays missing for long.
It's nothing. Nothing.
Things always turn up, for better?
Is something actually wrong or is this just some ploy to 
get us both here?
I meant what I said on the phone. I need your help.
We need your help.
GOSSIP GIRL: Or for worse?
NATE: Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
-Where are we going? -Take her upstairs.
Dorota, coffee, fast.
-Come, Serena. SERENA: I just wanna sleep.
We have to get her in the shower, keep her talking and 
awake. Come on.
Dorota, will you please get her a fresh change of clothes 
and a bathrobe?
Of course, Miss Blair.
So we have every hangover cure known to man.
Plus bagels, these should help soak up the alcohol and 
whatever else she took.
Thank you, I'll take it from here.
Oh, my God.
-Come on, come on. SERENA: Hey, it's cold, it's too 
cold.
Just like old times.
You know, why do I get the feeling you're actually 
enjoying this?
---------------------------------------
Call me sentimental.
-We may not need those bagels after all. -What's going 
on with her?
She was here last night, scared. She....
She told me something crazy...
...but was too freaked out to find the words to explain it.
I went upstairs to find my mom's Valiums to calm her 
down...
...but when I got back, she was gone.
-It took me all night to find her. -What exactly did she 
say to you?
That's beside the point.
We're here to help Serena, no matter what the problem 
is.
Hey, could you maybe read that somewhere else?
I don't like the Post.
Is that why you subscribe?
Another thing I don't like.
My son depressed.
-Don't know if you've talked to him. -We've talked.
He and Serena, should I be worried?
It's been a little bumpy lately, sure.
The recent bump's our friend, Sarah. Serena's a little 
jealous.
But Sarah's cool, so as soon as Serena gets to know 
her, everything will be fine.
ROADIE: Okay, that's good.
VANESSA: I love that picture of you.
Yeah, me too.
---------------------------------------
JOURNALIST: Tell me where you took this photograph.
What undoubtedly could be called the band's most wellknown image.
-Oh, well, I wouldn't go that far. -I would.
It's positively iconic.
Were you and Rufus Humphrey already involved when 
you took it?
-Excuse me? -Rufus Humphrey.
Lead singer of Lincoln Hawk, was this before or after-
-?
I don't feel comfortable discussing anything other than 
my work.
I was talking about your work.
Why did you give up photography?
Was it too hard to continue shooting after you'd broken 
his heart?
Just a moment, please. Ahem.
Oh, you know, I see I'm interrupting, so I'll--
No, I have to say I have never been happier to see you, 
Dan.
I've been waiting downstairs for Serena.
I figured she has to come home sometime soon.
So have you heard from her?
Have you tried calling?
Pretty sure she lost her phone.
Charles said he was going over to Blair's to pick her up 
after you left.
-Maybe try there. -Oh, yes, Charles.
Charles, of course. Thank you so much.
I really appreciate your coming all the way to the Palace 
---------------------------------------
to conduct this interview...
...but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. I've a wedding 
to attend, my own.
Do you think you were able to take such incredible 
photos of Rufus Humphrey...
...because of how much you were in love with him?
Well, I wasn't in love with him. Um....
That much.
Thank you for your time.
BLAIR: Dorota, bring the towels upstairs. -What's taking 
so long?
Huh. Guess I missed a chapter.
-Or four, don't all of you hate each other? -Yes.
-No. -Absolutely.
That's fascinating and ripe for psychiatrist's case 
study...
...but I am looking for Serena.
She's not here.
-Tsk. I think she is. -No, she just left.
You must have crossed paths.
I don't believe you.
Fine.
I didn't wanna have to tell you this, but she doesn't 
wanna see you.
Really?
Yes, really.
-Serena. -She's telling the truth, man.
Are you really gonna stop me from seeing my girlfriend?
-Come on. SERENA: What are you doing?
---------------------------------------
-S. -It's okay.
What's happening?
Dan.
Something is going on, and I just wanna be let in on what 
it is.
It's hard to explain.
Let me make it easy for you. I know you're keeping 
something from me.
I'm sick of being the only one you don't talk to.
-I'm not talking to anyone. -What are they doing here?
While I get a call from a bartender who says you left a 
bar with a bunch of guys?
What guys, Serena?
Who were they?
I don't know.
-Did something happen last night? -Please don't.
Is that what you're so afraid to tell me, that you cheated 
on me?
Did you cheat on me last night?
All I need is a yes or a no. Did you sleep with someone 
else?
Yes.
[VOICE BREAKS] Yeah.
I'm done.
I'm done.
-Hey. GEORGINA: Hey, did you find Serena?
Yeah, but I kind of wish I hadn't.
That doesn't sound so good.
I'm just in the park, wanna meet me, maybe talk about 
---------------------------------------
it?
I'm a pretty good listener.
Dan?
Yeah, yeah, I'd like that.
Well, I wanted cymbidiums, not hyacinth.
And why did we choose fish?
It's unseasonably warm.
You know, I knew we should have gone with the Limoges 
instead of the Lenox.
What's the matter? You were fine this morning.
-Now you're finding fault with everything. -Nothing at 
all.
I'm just-- I've had three perfect weddings.
And I want this one to be more perfect than perfect, 
that's all.
Oh, finally.
So why are you still at Blair's?
LILY: You're supposed to be here.
Mrs. van der Woodsen, it is Dorota, Miss Waldorf's--
I know who you are, Dorota, but now isn't a very good 
time.
The wedding, I know.
Miss Serena is here.
Oh, yes, I know. I've heard several times today.
I know it's not my place, but Miss Serena is like the old 
days.
What are you trying to say?
I think you should have worry about your daughter.
Worry like before she went away.
---------------------------------------
Well, thank you, Dorota. I'll take care of it.
I am so sorry, but I'm gonna have to go.
Why do you have to go?
To do something I've done too many times before.
-Can I help you? -No, thank you, I have to do it alone.
[CRYING] I can't believe I just did that.
Then why did you? I mean, did you cheat on Dan?
No, I remember last night. Didn't do anything.
Why would you say that to him?
I would rather Dan think I cheated on him than know what 
I really did.
What you really did?
Dan puts me on a pedestal.
If he knew the truth, he would never look at me again.
You're starting to scare even me. What did you do?
Come on, you can tell us.
We've seen you with vomit in your hair, making out with 
bankers...
...in the men's room at PJ Clarke's.
-You don't have to hide anything from us. -Right, none 
of us are saints.
-I had sex with him in the back of a limo. -Several times.
I had sex with you at a wedding while I was her date.
Once.
I'm Chuck Bass.
BLAIR: You can tell us anything.
We don't judge.
We're the non-judging Breakfast Club.
---------------------------------------
We're your best friends.
Anything you do is something we did too.
If I tell you, it can never leave this room.
You all know Georgina Sparks.
Some of us better than others.
Not like you didn't lose your virginity to her in seventh 
grade.
Sixth, I've been avoiding her ever since. Bitch is psycho.
What about her?
Something happened the night of the Shepherd 
wedding.
-We're aware of what happened. -No, something else.
Something I've tried to escape, but Georgina won't let 
me.
And now she's blackmailing me.
-Blackmailing you? -With what exactly?
Well, it started when Blair thought you and I had too 
much to drink.
She told us to go outside, get some air, sober up.
SERENA: If the happy couple didn't wanna put up the 
cash for the premium bar...
...they should've made the wedding BYOB.
Instead, we went into the empty bar.
And I opened a bottle of champagne, and....
We can skip that part, okay?
Go ahead, I fill her in later.
I left in a hurry.
I felt so terrible.
So guilty for what I'd just done.
---------------------------------------
I just had to get out of there.
The East View Hotel, please.
Georgina and I had plans to meet up after, so I headed 
straight to her.
Little did I know she had a surprise waiting for me.
She's gonna lose her mind.
A genuine Serena van der Woodsen sex tape.
MAN: How exactly are we gonna do this?
Well, if you put the camera over there, she'll never know.
PETE: Are you sure she's gonna be down for this?
GEORGINA: It's Serena.
She goes down for anything.
Hey, baby. How are the new Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd?
SERENA: I didn't know at the time, but she was taping 
me.
Lucky for me, I was too stuck on what had just 
happened...
...to be much fun for anyone.
I can't believe I just did that.
Blair is my best friend.
What sort of person does that to her best friend?
This isn't therapy session. G, you promised a party.
So break out the favors.
-Thank you. -Oh, I don't feel so good.
She always gets frisky after she hurls.
No, Pete, I'm not in the mood, okay?
Come on.
I'm hot, okay? I'm too hot.
---------------------------------------
-Oh, you are too hot. -No, it's ho--
Why is it so hot here?
What is it?
-I can't. -Yes, yes, you can.
I'm scared.
We're right here.
No, I can't, I can't.
I can't do this, Pete, okay?
I can't.
You know, how about we do a couple lines first, okay?
Whatever, baby.
Here, go ahead.
Pete, are you okay?
What's happening? Are you okay?
Georgie, Georgie, Georgina.
What? Why are you screaming?
-What are you doing? -I'm calling 911.
You can't.
There's drugs everywhere.
We'll get in trouble, we can get arrested. We have to go.
-We can't leave him. -We have to.
Get everything on it that has you on it, go.
SERENA: Where's his phone? Where is his phone?
-What are you doing? SERENA: I'm calling.
Hi, we have an emergency.
Can you send someone right away to East View Hotel, 
Room 1411, please?
---------------------------------------
There's a guy, he's having seizures. I don't know what's 
wrong.
OPERATOR: I'm gonna need your name.... GEORGINA: 
We have to go.
Then Georgina told me we had to split up.
She said that someone might be looking for us.
But I couldn't go.
I just couldn't.
So I waited near the hotel across the street.
All I wanted was to see the paramedics helping Pete.
But that's not what I saw.
I didn't know what to do.
I just knew I had to leave right away.
I took a train heading north, and I got a room...
...convinced my mom that boarding school was a good 
idea, and....
Never said goodbye.
It makes sense now.
But what does she even want from you?
Well, when she came back, I told her that I'd moved on...
...from the lifestyle that she was still in, but she didn't 
like that.
So somehow she became friends with Dan and 
Vanessa...
...and called herself Sarah.
Why don't you just tell Dan about her?
Because she has that tape of me, and she'll use it.
It's practically a snuff film.
We need to find her.
---------------------------------------
No, please.
Promise me, please.
Promise me you won't do anything.
Because if you do, then she'll show Dan.
If he ever speaks to me again.
GOSSIP GIRL: Watch out, S.
Just because you tell the truth, doesn't mean there won't 
be consequences.
Oh, God, what have I done?
Sylvia, how are you?
Oh, wonderful.
Good to see you.
Thanks for coming with me, B.
-I'm really not feeling up to being social. -Of course.
Oh, excuse me.
You were supposed to be home hours ago. Come with 
me.
I'm sorry, Mom.
You look beautiful.
I hope you don't mind I asked Blair to come tonight.
What happened last night? Why didn't you come home?
Why was Dan looking for you?
And why did I get a call informing me that you were on 
drugs?
I wasn't on drugs.
Don't lie to me.
I saw that little home movie that you and your friends 
made.
---------------------------------------
-You watched that? -Well, only part of it.
I stopped when that guy had his tongue down your 
throat.
But I can pretty much guess how it ends.
No, it was a joke, we were just kidding. It's not what it 
look--
You know what? You are out of control.
I always knew you had a wild side, but how can you look 
at yourself?
What have you become?
I thought we were past all of this, Serena.
I thought you were doing so well.
I've nothing left but to send you to reformatory school.
What do you think about that?
What's wrong?
What happened?
Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt.
Tuned to F sharp minor.
Lisa, Sheckman told me to tell you you're almost up.
-Okay, thanks. -Thanks, Vanessa.
Hey.
-Hey. -This is incredible, Dad.
I hope you're nervous, because there's, like, a hundred 
people.
Which is 80 more than the last time you played.
Lisa, this is my sarcastic son, Dan, and his friend Sarah.
-Hey, nice to meet you. -Pleasure.
-Nice to meet you. -I'll see you all later.
---------------------------------------
Oh, no Serena?
I'll take good care of him, Mr. Humphrey, promise.
Jenny's already called me 15 times to make sure that I 
call her...
...during "Something Like That" so she can hear you 
mess up.
-So break a leg. -Heh.
I'll be in the front row, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Georgina.
Georgina.
-I think she thinks she knows you. -Never seen her 
before in my life.
Let's go get a drink.
LILY: Remember that new offer? -Yeah.
Don't send her away.
Blair, it's not polite to interrupt.
I don't care who hears.
-Just don't send her away. -Excuse me.
Thank you, Blair, but it's not exactly your business what 
I do with my daughter.
If anything, you're one of the reasons that I'm having to 
take such strong actions.
I say this with all due respect, Lily.
But you have no idea what your daughter's been going 
through.
She's in a lot of pain.
And I don't think the pain's gonna go away if she goes 
away.
I don't understand what you're trying to tell me.
---------------------------------------
Serena has a secret.
And she's been holding onto it for a long, long time.
And now it's finally catching up with her.
I'm out of my league here.
I can't do any more than I've done.
And it's not enough.
She needs you.
I saw the video. She doesn't need me.
She needs boundaries.
What you saw isn't the whole story.
-Hey, V, it's me. -You're not calling to cancel, are you?
Waiting 20 minutes before the concert isn't the best way 
to let a girl down.
No, I'm calling to let you know I may be 10 minutes late 
because--
Drum roll, please.
--I'm actually gonna take the subway to the show. -Haha. Subway? -Heh.
Nate Archibald, man of the people.
Oh, well, thank you.
Oh, and your name's on the list.
But if you don't see me, look for Dan and Sarah, they'll 
know where I am.
Wait, Sarah's there? With Dan?
As strange as it may seem, Dan is here.
It is his dad's gig.
I'm not talking about Dan, I'm talking about Sarah.
Okay, now you're totally weirding me out.
---------------------------------------
Sarah is not her real name. It's Georgina.
Serena told us this really messed up story about her.
Just do not trust anything she says, please.
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you what I can when I get there, okay?
Okay.
Okay, I'll see you soon.
-Here's the address you asked for. -Thank you, Charles.
Excuse us.
BLAIR: Hello?
NATE: Hey, I only have a second, I'm on my way to 
Queens.
-Ugh. Gross, why? -To meet Vanessa at a concert.
It got grosser.
We've been hanging out, not that I owe you any 
explanation.
But I do I feel like I should tell you, Georgina's with her 
and Dan.
She's there?
Yeah, you know Serena doesn't want us to do anything...
...but I just thought you might wanna know.
Where are you right now?
74th and Lex.
Don't move, we'll pick you up in 10.
-I have to handle this thing with Serena. -Now?
Yes, now.
It's our rehearsal dinner, and you're the bride.
I know, but I'm also a mother, and that's more important.
---------------------------------------
So your problems are my problems. Let me come and 
help.
I can't. I wish I could explain.
Seems to be a lot lately you that you can't explain.
I'm sorry.
But this is between me and my daughter.
What's gotten into you?
What if I told you I knew where Georgina Sparks was right 
now?
I'd say let's get the bitch.
GOSSIP GIRL: Spotted.
Blair and Chuck reunited to defend Serena's honor.
With friends like these, who needs armies?
So where are we?
It's the Fairman's house.
This is where the boy who died grew up.
And his parents are expecting you.
Mom, I can't go in there.
Sweetie, if I've learned anything in life...
...it's that sometimes things get in your path, and you 
have a choice.
You can either smash right into them, or you can adjust 
and move around.
But you have to do one or the other in order to move 
forward.
How can I do this?
I'm gonna be right by your side.
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, how about a round of 
applause for Lisa Loeb?
---------------------------------------
Hey, everyone, how are you doing?
I'm Lisa Loeb, and I'm your host for tonight.
And I am so happy you're all here. Thank you so much 
for coming.
We've got a lot of great acts lined up.
Hey, V, I didn't realize you'd be able to hang during the 
concert.
Do you have something you wanna say to me?
Not that I know of.
You sure about that, Georgina?
My friend says Serena told him some story about you.
And he's on his way to fill me in, unless you wanna do 
that first?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm not a big fan of liars, and neither is Dan.
I'm giving you a chance to explain yourself here.
-Where's Sarah going? -I don't know who she is.
Nate called me and said her name is Georgina.
That's what that girl back there called her.
-Why would she lie about her name? -I think there's 
some other stuff too.
Vanessa, Rufus can't find the set list.
You know where it is? I taped it into the top of his Gibson 
case. Uh--
I'll get it.
This will just take two minutes.
Jus don't go anywhere, stay right here. I'll be right back.
Are you okay?
No.
---------------------------------------
No, I feel terrible, Mom.
Oh, you heard what they said.
Look, Peter was an addict for 10 years.
His own parents couldn't get him to stop using.
There's no way that a 16-year-old girl could have.
They don't hold you responsible.
You don't need to blame yourself.
But I am responsible, Mom. I'm the one that gave him 
the line that killed him.
Serena, those were his drugs, okay?
If you hadn't have given them to him, he would have 
taken them himself.
Then why do I still feel like this?
Because contrary to what I might have said earlier...
...you are a good person.
Who since that night has been living your life with care 
and compassion...
...and respect for yourself and for others.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
Thank you.
There's something else I have to do.
-Will you help me? -Absolutely.
Take me to see Dan.
Okay, so your name is really Georgina.
But I don't understand why you feel you had to lie.
Because my boyfriend want--
My ex-boyfriend, when we broke up, he wasn't too 
happy about it...
---------------------------------------
...and things got out of control.
Okay, well, what happened?
I came home one day, and my car was broken into.
And then a week later, my room was trashed...
...and I got really scared.
I changed all my numbers, I moved in with a friend...
...and yet he still tracked me down.
It was my mom's idea to change my name and move out 
of town.
I hate being away from my family, but it's better than 
getting hurt, right?
Yeah, right.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, I wasn't supposed to tell 
anyone.
No, no, no, I know. I get that, I get it.
And I also didn't want you to think less of me, 
because....
I haven't wanted to admit it, but....
From the moment I met you, I've been falling for you.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm saying.
Hey, it's really loud here.
Do you wanna go somewhere else? Someplace quiet, 
we can talk?
But your dad's about to go on.
He'll understand.
It's not like we won't be watching this on YouTube for 
the next five years.
All right, come on.
Some date we got here, you even brought your friends.
---------------------------------------
-The ones I can't stand. -Where's Georgina?
What are you gonna do?
-You heard what Serena said. -Like we care.
-Georgina left. -Left for where?
VANESSA: I don't know, she took off.
If I could only find Dan, he's here somewhere.
Well, let's go look for him. Alone.
SERENA: Okay, thank you.
-Hey, what are you doing here? -Hey, what are you 
doing here?
I'm a big Leaky Hawk fan.
I'm looking for Dan and Georgina.
-You're out of luck, Georgina's gone. -And Dan?
I'm out of luck, he's still around.
It's all over now.
I can finally tell Dan everything.
Will you help me find him?
All right, everybody, that was Lincoln Hawk.
Let's hear it.
Let's hear an encore from Rufus and the band.
One more time for Lincoln Hawk.
Get out of my way, Rufus.
No.
Get out of my way.
No.
LISA LOEB: All right, thank you.
So we're gonna take a quick break....
---------------------------------------
Hey, psst, it's for you.
Hey, thank God you called.
I'm looking for you, where are you?
With me.
Georgina?
I hear you told our little secret.
If that's the way you wanna play it, that's how we'll play 
it.
No, I'm not afraid of you anymore.
Oh? You should be.
Because all bets are off.
Why? What are you gonna do?
It's not what I'm gonna do, sweetie.
It's who I'm gonna do it with.
No, I know Dan.
He's too good.
You sure about that?
-How everything go with your mom? -Good.
Yeah.
She was glad I finally found someone I could trust.
Are you sure that you don't mind missing the after 
party...
...to have coffee with me?
You know what, after the day I've had, there's no place 
I'd rather be.
GOSSIP GIRL: If I were you, S, I'd be worried.
In the city that never sleeps, a lot can happen in one 
night.
---------------------------------------
Sweet dreams, Serena.
XOXO, Gossip Girl.

WOMAN: Where has she been?
GOSSIP GIRL: And who am I?
That's one secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me. XOXO...
...Gossip Girl.
SERENA: Hey, Dan. I've been trying to reach you all 
night.
I know it's early.
Or late, if you haven't slept like me.
But I'm pretty sure after this message, I will have officially 
filled your voice mail.
So I....
I'm coming over.
-Hello? LILY: Who is it?
Hello? Yeah, this is Rufus.
I have to check with the guys, but I'm pretty sure we're 
available.
-Yeah, okay. -Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
What?
I just got the call. Lincoln Hawk is hitting the road.
We're opening for The Breeders. Luscious Jackson 
---------------------------------------
reunion didn't work out.
-Wait, what was your "Oh, my God"? -Nothing. Nothing 
at all.
It's day. As in wedding day.
As in...
...my wedding day.
Right.
But, uh, congratulations.
-Thanks. -No.
Thank you for last night. It was--
Amazing.
RUFUS: It's Bart. -That's what I was afraid of.
-Want me to answer it? -Do you want me to kill you?
Hello?
No, I know.
Well, that's because we're not supposed to see each 
other...
...on the day of the wedding.
Okay. That's fine. I'll meet you in an hour.
I don't know what Bart wants, but I have to go talk to 
him.
What about? Any topics in particular?
Well, I'm sure I'll think of something.
Who, what, when, where, why?
We were up late plotting against Georgina. We dozed 
off.
-You were on the floor. -I didn't wanna hurt my back.
-It's not like you ever do anything athletic. -Well, that's 
not entirely true, now, is it?
---------------------------------------
Fine. Nothing that requires removing your scarf.
-That was one time. It was chilly. -Enough about the 
past.
Before you landed in my bed, we actually landed on a 
good idea.
Well, I trust you can take it from here.
I have a best man speech to write and no time to write 
it.
I can be bitch enough for both of us.
I still have the scars on my back to prove it.
You know, they say if you love something, you should 
set it free.
Ugh! When you hate something you should slam the door 
on its face.
I love it when you talk dirty, Blair.
Wow. Stint in rehab sure didn't slow you down a bit.
You kidding? I haven't felt this good in years.
Clean and sober. Lawyers feeling great about the trial.
Nice. Well, sometimes things just work out, huh?
Sometimes they do. We can celebrate tonight at the 
wedding.
When's Mom back from the Hamptons?
She's not gonna make it. Landscapers royally screwed 
up the yard.
Apparently, all our shrubs look like circus bears.
She's gonna miss the wedding to deal with that?
That and the leak we had in the basement. Place is a 
mess.
I just was kind of hoping both you guys could meet 
Vanessa.
Oh, right.
---------------------------------------
Right. I forgot you had a date.
You and I can just hang till then.
The Yankees are on today. Joba's pitching lights out.
All right. Sounds good.
I gotta take this.
-It's my sponsor. -Oh, sorry.
I'll just see you at home, then.
Hey, it's me.
Yes, yes. Everything as discussed.
Don't be late, don't be early.
I'll slip out right after the ceremony. Just be there waiting.
Hey.
I'm sorry. I know it's early, but I couldn't sleep.
I had to see you. And you're here.
Which means you slept here, which is a relief but not a 
surprise.
GEORGINA: Serena.
But that is surprising.
They say love conquers all.
But maybe love never met Georgina Sparks.
Poor Humphrey.
Looks like our resident moral compass isn't such a 
straight arrow after all.
Serena, I'm sorry. The way Dan was talking, I thought it
was over.
-Over? -Maybe not exactly over, but--
I should go. This is not what I had planned.
No, I think it's exactly what you had planned.
---------------------------------------
Serena, this is not Sarah's fault.
-No, it's Georgina's. -Whatever.
I never meant to get in between you two. I swear.
Hey, please. It's okay.
No, it's not, because now she's upset.
Yeah, I am, you manipulative psycho bitch! What are you 
doing?
You have been planning this the whole time. She's lying 
to you, Dan.
Goodbye, Dan.
I am telling him everything.
Tell me what?
What is it that you need to tell me?
So my mom took me to see his parents.
And after talking to them...
...all I wanted was to come and find you and tell you 
everything.
-Do you hate me? -No, no, no, of course not.
This is just....
It's a lot.
And I really, really wish that you'd told me this sooner.
No, I know it's my fault.
I was just so scared.
I get it. I get it.
I mean, "Hey, I think I killed someone...
...I'm being blackmailed by a girl pretending to be 
someone else"...
...doesn't quite roll off the tongue.
---------------------------------------
But it's all over, right?
I mean, we can fix this?
Serena, I.... Last night--
It's okay. You and Georgina and Vanessa were just 
hanging out.
And it got late and you fell asleep.
I'll see you at the wedding?
When I told my mom not to go away with Rufus...
...I said it was because you and I were forever.
I know I was right.
BLAIR: Hello?
Blair. It's Dan.
LILY: Bart, darling.
What is the big mystery?
What are we doing here?
BART: This is the first building I ever bought.
Well, it's quite impressive.
You got a good eye even back then.
Sometimes I like to come here just to feel how it felt the 
first time I saw it.
Well, there is a comfort in revisiting the things that we 
loved...
...when we were young.
But the truth is, I'm not that young man anymore.
I think maybe I've outgrown this place.
Holding on to it is keeping me from moving forward...
...with what's most important to me now.
What do you think I should do?
---------------------------------------
I think you should let it go.
I agree.
Now can you do the same for me?
GEORGINA: Hey, it's Sarah. You know what to do.
-Voice mail. -Okay, like we talked about.
Hey. Hey, it's me, Dan.
After you left, Serena and I got in a huge fight.
And she said all this crazy stuff. I honestly don't know 
what to believe.
But what I do know is that I wanna see you.
So call me.
Excellent work. She's totally calling back.
This is so weird. I don't normally do plots against people.
Don't worry, virgin. I'll talk you through it.
Right on schedule.
DAN: Hey. -Hey.
-I just got your message. -Oh, good, good.
So sorry about this morning with Serena.
That was very awkward, to say the least.
Yeah, little bit.
Last night really changed things for me.
Serena and I left things kind of uncertain, so I think I 
wanna end it.
I know I do. Will you meet me?
Our spot in the park by the pond?
See you there.
We're turning around.
---------------------------------------
One last battle and the war is won.
Humphrey, you are a born liar.
Thanks, I think.
All that stuff about last night was genius. Anything you 
wanna tell me?
No. Like you said, just born to lie.
Honestly, Dan, last night was fun...
...but I didn't really know what it would all mean to you.
Well, I normally don't jump into things like that. So when 
I do, it means a lot.
Me too. That's why I think we should be together forever.
Georgina, look. Serena told me everything.
-All right? And I believe it. -No, you don't understand.
She was upset and jealous. She told you things to make 
you think the worst of me.
-No, just stop it. -I never meant... ...for this to happen, 
but it did.
And I know you feel it too. I mean, how else do you 
explain last night?
I don't know. I don't know, and I wish I could.
So you're just gonna go back to Serena like nothing 
happened...
...and just leave me all alone?
BLAIR: Oh, you're not alone, G.
I'm here now.
And I brought some people who really, really wanna see 
you.
I think you remember your parents.
The only thing feared by the spawn of Satan?
Mom and Dad.
---------------------------------------
Leave it to Blair Waldorf to know that bitches don't just 
happen.
They're made, by parents even more wicked than their 
offspring.
Okay. Mom, Dad...
...this is not what you think. Believe me.
There, there, Georgie. It's gonna be okay.
No. This time it won't.
Or it won't. Your parents were so worried, G.
They told me everything.
You were on the equestrian circuit, but sold your pony 
for cocaine.
That was a difficult time, but I put that behind me.
When? When you were in rehab?
It's hard to get clean when you hitchhike into town...
...steal a credit card and book a ticket to Ibiza.
You didn't see where they sent me. That place was 
awful. It was in Utah.
-I lasted longer than Lohan. -We were trying to help.
-I've had enough. I have to go. -Georgina, stop.
BLAIR: Yes, stay, Georgina. I'll go.
Oh, that reminds me.
I almost forgot to leave you with the information...
...I discussed with your parents.
-What's this? -Where you're going.
A boot camp for troubled girls.
FATHER: Blair was kind enough to do some research.
Haven't you heard? I'm the crazy bitch around here.
---------------------------------------
Have fun at reform school.
DAN: So how long you gonna be on the road?
I'll get the details, we'll figure it out. It's kind of cool, 
right?
It's very cool.
Affirmation from my son. This is an historic moment.
Last night must have been pretty historic as well...
...considering when I came home, you hadn't.
Yeah, last night was pretty special.
I'm sorry I skipped out early, by the way, Dad.
I'd love to hear all about it.
But I have a wedding.
-The wedding. -Right, the wedding.
Of course.
So it's happening.
Yeah. Yeah, Dad, it is.
Serena told me something about you and Lily.
I don't understand it fully, but the reason Lily stayed 
away...
...is because Serena asked her to.
Thanks, Dan. That's....
Well, just thanks.
JENNY: Check out my latest creation.
VANESSA: What do you think?
Well, you clean up nice, Abrams.
BLAIR: Thank you.
Best man speech going that well?
---------------------------------------
There won't be a dry eye in the house.
Trust me.
-How did things go with Whore-gina? -Not a dry eye 
either.
-Good to know I wasn't missed. -Dan Humphrey lent a 
hand.
It was nice to see him get his dirty for once. Not sure 
how much fun he had, though.
No one ever enjoys their first time.
Except you.
Save me a dance?
Now that Georgina's done, so are you and I.
She was the last thing we had in common.
-Break a leg. -I think I just did.
HOWIE: Here he is. Best man ready to do his dad proud?
Captain, good to see you. Nate.
Clearly I missed something when I was away.
A little advice, fellows.
You've been friends a long time.
Whoever she is, she's not worth it.
-Couldn't agree more. -That's the problem.
-Hey. -Hey.
How go the prenuptials?
Well, my mom's done this enough times, you'd think 
she'd be a pro by now.
But I don't know. Her heart doesn't really seem in it.
You think this will be us in 20 years?
Onto our fourth husbands?
---------------------------------------
A girl can dream.
Speaking of true love.
Dan isn't here.
-He's coming. -So all is forgiven?
I'm working on it.
What do you have to work on? He's the one that has to 
forgive you.
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm working on.
HOWIE: You were supposed to get here... ...during the 
reception so no one would know.
-You don't exactly blend in, you know -You gonna pay 
me or not?
Here.
Goodbye.
Do me a favor and keep an eye on Mr. Archibald.
Need a hand with that?
Rufus, what are you doing here? I thought we had 
security.
You want them to throw me out?
Well, I'd like the option, considering how much I'm 
paying them.
RUFUS: So you want me to leave?
-I didn't say that. -Do you want me to call off this 
wedding?
And if you so much as nod yes, I will go out there...
...and I will tell your fiance and your guests they have to 
go home.
I didn't say that either.
-We can figure this out. -Oh, can we?
It's been 20 years.
---------------------------------------
And I don't think this is the moment to hash out the 
details.
We've already had the morning after today. What's 
gonna happen tomorrow morning?
Lil, I just got a divorce.
I don't wanna get married again, at least not right away.
LILY: But I do.
I've been alone for quite a while now and you know what, 
it's hard.
And I love Bart. Not just because he has money.
I have enough money. Not that you can ever have 
enough money.
But I'm rambling.
And I'm nervous.
-You make me nervous. -That's a good thing, right?
There are just too many questions. What about Dan and 
Serena?
Whatever their feelings are, if we're standing here, 20 
years in the making....
Yeah.
Those 20 years, they have to count for something, don't 
they?
I think they count for everything.
Where's my mom? Shouldn't we be saying vows around 
now?
Your mother is a wonderful woman, Eric, but being on 
time, not a strong suit.
Let's pray Lily is as slow getting dressed as you are.
-You said you knew how to make a tie. -How would I 
know?
-I hope Serena doesn't kill me. -For being a few minutes 
late?
---------------------------------------
Amongst other things.
-I really have to talk to her. -Georgina?
I thought if I confronted her, it would make things better.
But it didn't. And now--
Now I have to tell her.
No time like the present. I'm gonna find my seat, okay?
-Hey. -Hey.
-Hey, I have to talk to you. -I can't. I have to go.
-It can't wait. It's about Georgina. -I don't wanna know.
You need to. I didn't sleep with her.
-Well, then-- -But I may as well have.
Serena, there you are.
Come, yeah? Come, come, come.
SERENA: I have to go.
And here we go. Are you sure about this?
Ask me again and I'll change my mind.
I love you, Lily.
I love you too, Rufus.
Then have a great wedding and try not to trip or anything.
I can't believe you put that in my mind.
Well, luckily, I have done this before.
Yeah.
Hey.
How rude. Can you believe how late she is?
GOSSIP GIRL: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here 
today... ...in the face of this company...
...to watch this man and this woman totally eff things up.
---------------------------------------
Excuse me while I pull out a hanky and pass it to S and 
D.
Looks like I'm not the only one who cries at weddings.
-How's your food? -Good, thanks.
I was being sarcastic. You haven't eaten.
-Let's go somewhere quiet, we can talk. -Excuse me, I 
need some air.
-He's getting away. -You sure?
That's all I got.
I'll be right back.
I need to talk to you. Your father's leaving.
-He just called my mom. -Everything okay?
-Yes. -No.
-He asked to have his car brought around. -Left his 
phone in it.
Before the ceremony, I saw him with a guy doing a deal.
-It looked like drugs. -My father is clean, Chuck.
-What are you, spying on him? -Look, I know you hate 
me.
I was in love with Blair and I'm sorry.
We do not have time to argue about this.
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop.
Dad, what the hell are you doing?
-I left you a note at home. -Yeah? What's it say?
-It says I'm sorry. -For what?
Dad, if you've relapsed, it's okay. We'll get you help.
-Chuck saw you earlier. -I wasn't buying drugs.
NATE: Passport?
---------------------------------------
You're skipping town?
I'll be a much better father to you from Dominica than I 
will be from jail.
No, Dad. I know you're scared, but we'll get through the 
trial.
No, we won't.
I'm guilty, Nate. I'm facing 25 years.
So all the stuff about things looking good and working 
out, huh? Yeah.
What about Mom?
Who do you think is paying for the private plane?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want you to know anything, be an accessory.
This is the best thing for everyone.
I need you to step up right now, be the man of the family 
for your mother.
It's been that for a while now.
Nate.
That's for Mom.
Looks like Nate isn't a fan of the fish.
-Or his date. -Blair.
I'm with Nate and you are at the singles table.
Deal with it.
I just feel sorry for you is all.
Dating an Archibald is a tortured process. The endless 
supply of family drama.
The fact that he never really got over Serena.
Falling for someone who's in love with Serena...
...you already know how that feels, don't you?
---------------------------------------
Have you seen Chuck? It's time for his speech.
I'll look for him.
Maybe he's with my date.
Excuse me.
-So thank you. -It's your dad.
It's bigger than all the other stuff.
I'm sorry.
For all of it.
So am I.
So you said you loved her.
That's a....
Well, I've never heard you say that before.
About anyone.
You ready to go back in?
I don't think I'm going back in.
-Just tell Vanessa I-- VANESSA: Tell Vanessa what?
They're looking for you inside.
It's a long story.
I have time.
Hey, don't run away from me.
Dan, it's okay.
So you hooked up with Georgina.
I kind of figured that when I saw her... ...coming out of 
your bedroom this morning...
...but I'm willing to let it go.
I don't wanna break up with you.
Maybe....
---------------------------------------
Maybe I wanna break up with you.
Maybe I can't just let it go. You lied to me, over and over.
-And it was easy for you. -No, it wasn't.
I got seduced by a girl pretending to be someone else. 
You knew.
But I couldn't say anything.
You were afraid I'd find out you thought you killed 
someone.
And I was hoping you'd understand.
I am the most understanding person in the world.
But this? And this is not about who you used to be.
Your past or who you were when we met.
The reason I was with Georgina...
...was because you slept with two random guys you met 
in a bar.
No, I didn't. I just said that.
How is that less crazy?
Because I thought it would be easier to forgive than what 
I really did.
So, what, Dan?
We're exactly where we were at the Basses' 
brunch... ...when we first started dating.
I'm not who you thought I was and you can't forgive that.
I just think too much has happened.
I don't know how to make things go back to what they 
were.
So that's it, then?
It's just:
"Have a good summer, I'll see you back at school"?
---------------------------------------
I guess.
Yeah.
I'd like to propose a toast.
My father is someone who goes after what he wants.
And Lily van der Woodsen was no exception.
In typical Bass man fashion, his pursuit was direct.
And at times, not exactly subtle.
One thing I learned from my father's courtship of Lily...
...is the importance of perseverance.
That in the face of true love, you just don't give up.
Even if the object of your affection is begging you to.
And one thing I learned from Lily is the importance of 
forgiveness.
She gave my father the gift of a second chance...
...and, in kind, I've watched him become someone 
actually worthy of that gift.
And one day...
...I hope I'll be lucky enough to find someone...
...who will do the same for me.
-To the happy couple. PEOPLE: Cheers.
To us.
BLAIR: That was quite a speech.
All your hard work must have paid off.
That wasn't what I wrote. I was inspired in the moment.
Look, I know I said some horrible things, even for me.
You mean blogging to Gossip Girl about our sex life...
...and comparing me to your dad's sweaty old horse?
---------------------------------------
What's your point?
What's yours?
You don't belong with Nate.
Never have, never will.
You don't belong with anyone.
Sorry, I'm looking for Vanessa.
Have you seen her? I'm trying to get out of here.
No, I haven't seen her.
Okay.
Serena, Dan, out on the floor.
-Oh, no, no. -Oh, no, thank you.
The bride and groom are asking for photos. Here we go.
-That's not necessary. MAN: Yes, it is.
You're gonna wanna remember this night forever, yeah?
I'm sorry.
Just smile.
Let's take it slow this time. Do it right.
Chuck Bass is a romantic. Who knew?
Now you do.
That's all that matters.
-He's gone, you can let go now. -I know.
I don't want to.
-Hey, Jen. -Oh, my God, Dad.
-Hello to you too. -Mom's getting bagels...
...Dan's at the gallery and the mail just came.
I appreciate the play-by-play. It's as if I'm there.
---------------------------------------
Yeah, well, the letter came from Parsons about my 
internship.
-What does it say? -I don't know, I'm too scared to open 
it.
-What if I didn't get it? -What if you did?
Okay, opening it. Hold my hand over the phone.
-I got you. -And....
-Ah! I got it. -That's great, Jen.
-Does it say who it's with? -Yeah, uh, it's with...
..."Eleanor Waldorf Designs."
-Isn't that Blair's mom? -Yeah.
Yeah, it sure is.
So Tuscany with Chuck? Sounds romantic, minus the 
Chuck part.
He invited me, in his father's private plane.
And I was headed to France so....
So it's worth a week with Chuck to avoid airport security?
-Oh, don't worry, I'm gonna frisk him. -Oh, B, gross.
What can I say? He brings out the worst in me.
And weirdly, I think I bring out the best in him.
He's been a perfect gentleman.
Is that why you're driving yourself to the airport?
He wanted to see his dad before he left.
Besides, we're taking the helicopter to Teterboro.
I have to sit in the jump seat so I can tell the pilot if I 
have thoughts on his flying.
Oh, B, what's it gonna take to get you to relax?
-Chuck. -Oh, God, my ears are bleeding.
---------------------------------------
Make it stop.
You gonna be okay? Alone all summer?
Without your best friend to get you out of trouble?
Yeah, I'm looking forward to staying out of trouble for a 
while.
Have you talked to Dan?
No, not since the wedding.
It's for the best.
For him, for me.
I'm fine, really.
CHUCK: I'll be taking off. Wanted to catch my dad before 
I left.
See how the honeymoon went, catch a glimpse of a man 
in love.
Well, why don't you just take a look in the mirror, Chuck?
Taking Blair to Europe, huh? Things are getting serious.
It's no big deal. My dad's jet was going to Italy on 
business.
Blair was going to France.
So you planning to spend the summer sweating it out in 
Brooklyn?
I think my time across the bridge is over.
CHUCK: Nathaniel, what happened with you and Punky 
Brewster?
So tell me, what exactly happened with you and ManBangs?
He is prettier than me, but that wasn't the problem.
What was it? The perpetually stoned, brooding guy 
thing?
I actually enjoyed the quiet. It was a nice change of pace 
from you.
---------------------------------------
-Oh. Was it his past with Serena? -No, that's just your 
issue.
Must've been the different worlds thing.
One of you always feeling like a fish out of water?
I know exactly what you're doing.
Ask me questions about Nate and I won't ask you about 
Serena.
Best offense is always a strong defense.
I'm not ready to talk about it.
Her. Then maybe you'll be quiet for 30 seconds.
No, you better get used to it, Abrams. Welcome to the 
summer of Dan Humphrey.
Babbling at your ass 24/7. From dusk till dawn.
Come Labor Day, you're gonna be so sick of me.
It's been 13 years and I'm still not sick of you.
Well, not for a lack of trying.
NATE: Vanessa's a great girl. I just have too much going 
on right now.
-All right, all right, bye. -Hey.
-Hey. -I was just seeing off Blair.
I was just on the phone with Chuck.
Blair and Chuck. Now, there's a couple you can root for.
Yeah, well, if they're happy, I guess I'm happy.
Oh, come on, Nate, when have you ever been happy?
Wow, the gloves are off today, aren't they?
Well, I am feeling frisky. You know how I get in the 
summer.
Yeah, I do. Well, you won't have to witness any of it.
I'm locking myself away in the Hamptons house.
---------------------------------------
-Well, it is a summer to reflect. Alone. -I could not agree 
more.
I just need to take a break away from everything and 
everyone.
Yeah.
Hey, um, if you wanna reflect alone together, I'll be 
around.
What are you up to now?
-Excuse me, is that the Bass helicopter? -No, it's not 
here yet.
-Are you on the Bass Marketing team too? -No, I'm a 
guest of Chuck Bass.
If he's anything like his father, he must be terrifying.
He's not all bad. He is taking me to Tuscany.
That's romantic.
-So where is he? -On his way.
I had to get here early. I like the jump seat.
-Oh. -What?
Nothing, it's just, I like the jump seat.
I have this thing about flying and it makes me feel more-
-
In control?
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-Who's that? -Blair. I should get going.
I wanted to see you before I disappeared for the 
summer.
-I'm glad you had a good trip. -Hope you have a good 
trip.
You deserve it.
And I must say, I'm proud of you.
---------------------------------------
My best man speech was a week ago. It was nothing.
Polite, modest. You really are growing up. Let's not get 
carried away.
I plan on holding onto my youth.
-Sometimes that choice isn't up to you. -That's the best 
thing about Blair.
She knows me, knows I'll never change.
Yeah, until you take her away to Europe on a private jet.
That is gonna change everything. But that's a good 
thing, son.
Having a real girlfriend...
...will force you to learn about responsibility, sacrifice.
Being faithful.
Taking into account somebody else's feelings, not just 
your own.
Feelings?
All the partying, the women?
You will come back from this summer a new man.
Take my word for it.
Oh, I will.
Oh, there you are.
This is Amelia, she's been helping me with the apartment 
renovations.
Great. Nice to meet you.
Amelia.
A moment?
What's this?
I was hoping we could discuss what you have planned 
for my room.
---------------------------------------
And who are you?
I'm Chuck Bass.
-Everything all right? -Yeah, it's Chuck.
I guess his dad is getting in late and he won't be able to 
make the flight.
But he's booking something commercial.
Well, I'd be willing to flip you for the jump seat.
Bart did just get the jet reupholstered.
And I do like when the ladies make you those cookies.
What's 10 hours? Absence makes the heart grow fonder, 
right?
They say a leopard can't change his spots, but some 
things do change.
The path not taken can become a road-trip.
Being grounded can lead to something groundbreaking.
And whether they're sweating it out on the sultry 
sidewalks...
...or cooling their heels in the Hamptons, no one does
summer like New Yorkers.
Grab your shades and your sunblock. This one looks like 
a scorcher.
Until then, you know you love me. XOXO, Gossip Girl.
