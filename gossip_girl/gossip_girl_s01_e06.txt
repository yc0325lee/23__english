GOSSIP GIRL: And who am I?
That's one secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me. XOXO...
...Gossip Girl.
Long ago, when European royals grew bored with palace balls...
...they took a page from the peons, and added some pageantry.
Couture and canapes are just another Saturday night.
Until you add a mask.
But preparing for a ball is an event in itself.
Which is why queens invented handmaidens.
Dresses should be delivered, I'll take the small stuff.
Which one's yours?
Oh, no, I'm just helping Blair. But I mean, you know, we'll see.
Well, here's hoping.
-We'll put it on Blair's tab. -Oh, no, no, no--
The girls at that party are my best customers.
Why not show off my latest wares? Just return it after the ball.
SERENA: So Kati mentioned something about a custom-made corset.
---------------------------------------
-And I hear there are wigs involved? -It's a masquerade.
You have to conceal your identity.
But I do have something special planned for Nate 
tonight.
It's a game. It's a scavenger hunt.
Nate starts with a clue, which leads him to a lady-in-waiting...
...who gives him a clue to the--
Wait, you have ladies?
If he finds me before midnight when the masks come off, he can claim his prize.
And what's that?
Yeah, right. Sorry.
I just figured that after everything that's happened...
...or hasn't happened, I should find some way to make it special.
Well, that's really romantic, Blair. Really.
Look, if you don't want me to come tonight, I totally understand.
What? No, I want you to come.
In fact, I was hoping you'd be one of my ladies.
Would you give Nate the last clue?
Are you sure you want me to?
Tonight is all about starting over. I trust you. And him.
Well, then I will be honored to serve you, my queen.
Well, besides, you're bringing Dan, right?
---------------------------------------
DAN: A ball? -Haven't you heard? Your sister's Cinderella.
And let me guess, your wicked stepsister is Blair Waldorf.
Blair may have asked me to do things, I'm happy to help.
-If she helps with an invite and outfit? -It'll be worth it.
Everyone in disguise, in this old ballroom, it's gonna be amazing.
I'm actually surprised Serena didn't mention it.
Why? We've only been out twice.
It's not like we have to do everything together.
I gotta go deliver this stuff.
Let me know if you need me to pick you up a tux.  What?
It's a masked ball. She thinks I'd never go to something that pretentious.
Which shows she knows me well.
I know him. A masked ball.
Dan would never go to something that pretentious.
-Where he has to wear a mask and a tux. -He likes you.
He would wear a tux, and a mask and one of my mother's dresses...
...if it meant that he could go out with you.
Are you worried that he already has a date? I mean, he is Dan Humphrey.
Shut up.
I don't know. I guess a masked ball is better than a regular party.
All those kids from school that he hates, he won't even recognize them.
-All right, invite him, I insist. -I'm not saying I wouldn't go.
---------------------------------------
If Serena asked me, I wouldn't deprive her of my company.
-No, that would be too cruel. -But she hasn't asked me, so.
If you wanna go with her, just make it happen, put yourself out there.
This happens in a matter of hours.
The window for bold gestures is officially closed.
Is that her?
No, it's Vanessa.
Vanessa? That's been a while.
-You gonna answer that? -Of course, why wouldn't I?
Hello? Vanessa.
WOMAN: Hi, yeah, it's me.
So, what's up? So how's Vermont?
Do you still have my copy of The Crying of Lot 49?
Um, I don't know.
Well, could you check?
I haven't talked to you in over a year, you call to ask me about an old book?
You know, it could be anywhere.
Try over by the window.
-Vanessa. -Surprise.
What?
-Oh, my God, so nice to see you. -How are you?
I can't believe you're here. What are you doing here?
My parents said I could finish high school in the city.
---------------------------------------
-So that means you're-- -I'm back for good.
-That is-- -Awesome, I hope.
Yeah, totally.
Yes, of course. It's just unexpected, you know.
Unexpectedly awesome.
Go ahead, answer that. I'm starving, and I smell waffles.
-Rufus. RUFUS: Vanessa?
VANESSA: Surprise. -Serena, hey.
Hey, hi.
BLAIR: Go ahead, do it.
Uh.... Hey, I was just wondering, are you doing anything tonight?
Tonight? No, no, nothing, why?
Good, because there's this thing, and you're probably gonna think it's stupid--
Try me.
Even cold, these are so good.
I've missed Rufus' cooking. I have.
-Rufus, do you have whipped cream? -Who is that?
It's my sister.
You were saying something.
Hi, Blair. What do you want me to do with this stuff?
Oh, just leave them over there, that's fine. I left you another list.
DAN: Hello? Is anyone there?
I'm sorry, what?
You were asking me something.
No. Uh.... No, never mind.
---------------------------------------
-Thank you, have a good day. -Okay.  Bye.
So, what are we doing tonight?
I think I need a date.
Damn it, Anne. I told you no starch.
Howard, we've been going to the same cleaners for 19 years.
Your shirts are exactly how they always are. We know this isn't about laundry.
Sorry, but I need everything to be perfect at Eleanor's party tonight.
I can't screw up.
Eleanor knows you're the best person to take her company public.
She's going to pick you. Just show up and be yourself.
I'm gonna call you from the office. I gotta look over the proposal one more time.
NATE: Hey, Mom. -Oh, Nate.
Is everything okay with Dad?
Just work stuff, nothing for you to worry about.
Sure.
God, I love New York.
There was only one theater in Woodbury, and all it ever played were family movies.
The Pacifier played for like a year.
And they said Vin Diesel couldn't do comedy.
I can't pick, overwhelmed by choice. Whatever you want.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
---------------------------------------
You do wanna do something, right?
I mean, you don't have plans.
Big night out with overprivileged, underparented brats from your school?
-Yeah, the limo's waiting back at the loft.
-Good, we can egg it, slash the tires?
So is it weird having me back?
No, why would it be weird?
Because you said some things the night that I left.
Things that you immediately asked me to take back.
Because I was leaving, but now I'm here.
Yeah, and it's been over a year, you know.
A lot has happened, actually. I look forward to hearing about it, tonight.
Late show, Angelika. Whatever's playing.
-Unless it's The Pacifier. -Unless it's The Pacifier.
All right, I'll get tickets.
Glad to be home, Humphrey.
Glad to have you, Abrams.
CHUCK: So, what exactly are you looking for?
Evidence.
Of what?
Captain's dislike of starchy shirts?
I totally sympathize, the collars chafe.
Did you ask him about your missing college money?
Yeah, said he was moving accounts around. It was all back the next day.
So why worry? Mysterious financial transactions, warring parents.
---------------------------------------
Welcome to the Upper East Side.
Chi Chi, get the yeyo. Nathaniel, I'm shocked.
-Thought you were strictly an herbal man. -This isn't mine.
BLAIR: Who does this Dan Humphrey think he is?
Serena is putting up a strong front, but I can see how hurt she is.
-We have to help heal her heart. -But it's pretty late notice.
-The good ones are already taken. -No more excuses.
Serena must have the hottest date.
He's got plans, he'll change them. Got a girlfriend, he'll dump her.
If he's out of town, he'll charter a G5 and fly home.
Make it happen.
MAN: Do you like it? ELEANOR: That's outstanding.
-Is it a bong, Mother? -Please.
-I didn't take you for a stoner. -It's a--
A hookah, and it is adorable.
It's perfect for my Moroccan-themed party.
Why do you have to celebrate your Bendel's deal...
...by turning our penthouse into an opium den?
Why not?
BLAIR [ON RECORDING]: Hey, it's Blair.
Sorry I can't come to the phone, I'm getting ready for the masked ball.
See you tonight, if you recognize me, which you won't.
Hey, Blair, it's me.
I....
---------------------------------------
Look, I just really need to talk to you.  It's....
There's this thing with my dad, and....  You know, I just--
I really need to talk to you, so can you call me back when you can?
Thanks.
Well, that's all of it.
Thank you, I don't know what I would've done without you.
That's okay. Yeah, it was fun.
I'm glad. It's all part of your education.
And it looks like you're learning.
That's a nice bracelet. Vintage, right?
The diamonds look real.
That's because they sort of are.
The man at the store lent it to me.
Why would he do that?
Sweetie, you didn't think you were gonna be able to come tonight, right?
I thought maybe, yeah.
Jenny, freshmen don't get to go to the masked ball.
-It's just tradition. -No, I know.
-It's just that there were five dresses. -Oh, it--
You always need back-up.
What if I spilled something or a zipper broke?
Yeah, of course. I'll remember that.
-Have fun tonight. -I will.
---------------------------------------
And don't worry, your time will come, I promise.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get ready.
Do you think that Eleanor Waldorf will find this "night in Tangiers" enough?
Maybe if you brought a goat. Eleanor always goes all out.
Speaking of going all out.
SERENA: Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.
I don't think the Waldorf women ever met a theme they didn't just love.
You're going with Dan?
-Um.... No, Dan has plans actually. -Doing what?
The question is, with whom?
Oh, I didn't realize.
Well, frankly, I am relieved.
You know, at your age, you should be playing the field.
What about at your age? You got a hot date tonight?
What? No, please. Who would I be dating?
You know what? I'm gonna go try this on and see if I can find a goat.
SERENA: Well, he's no Dan, but I guess he'll do.
Hey, Jen, you're not gonna believe this, but Vanessa is back in town.
So we're going to a movie.
I don't know if you're going to that ball, I was wondering if you wanted to come.
So we're getting tickets online.
Call me back.
GOSSIP GIRL: Why is it that friends of Serena van der Woodsen...
---------------------------------------
...have to search for her suitor?
Have fables fallen so out of fashion...
...that princesses have to do everything themselves?
Call us old school, but sometimes the fairy tale ending...
...requires the knight to get off his ass and saddle up his steed.
DAN: Maybe it's never too late for a bold gesture.
SERENA: Nate, hey.
What are you doing here? I thought you were....
-Shouldn't you be getting ready? -I'm sorry to bother you.
It's....
Do you have a minute?
-Yeah, of course, come in. -Thanks.
Maybe it's old.
Left over from the '90s, from some night at Limelight or the Tunnel?
Our parents did worse stuff than we do.
It's not old. And it makes total sense.
I think he's having some money problems.
-Well, have you asked him about it? -Yup.
I just wish-- You know, I wish he'd be honest with me.
It's like he and my mom, they made some secret pact to act like robots.
I don't think that pact is so secret. I think all parents signed it.
But I'm not a little kid anymore. He doesn't have to shut me out.
If what you think is right, he's probably really scared.
Maybe you have to tell him how you feel more than once...
---------------------------------------
...for him to really hear you.
Hey, don't give up, okay?
You should probably go. You know, I've gotta get ready and stuff.
Yeah, me too.
-Thanks for just, you know, listening. -It's fine, don't worry about it.
Chuck just wanted to bump.
And Blair's phone was turned off, so it really means a lot.
Yeah, anytime, Nate.
I'll see you tonight, okay?
All right, I'll see you, bye.
Hey, anybody home?
-Hey, you and Dan going out? -Just to the movies.
What about you?
A Humphrey man in a sports coat?
-I'd normally ask if you had a date, but--
-But my wife left me.
Yeah, what's up with Alison? Dan says she's still upstate.
-I thought that was just for the summer. -So did her husband.
Okay, we'll circle back to that.
-One issue at a time. -Like, where are my keys?
What do you need keys for? Use Dan's window.
Where is Dan, by the way?
He should be back in a minute.
-So Dan seems happy to see you. -Why wouldn't he be?
---------------------------------------
Well, if you don't mind me saying so.
When you left here, you kind of broke his heart.
I'm back, aren't I?
I hated being away from the city. Away from Dan.
You tell Dan this?
No, not yet. But I'm planning on it tonight.
Before or after the movie, I'm not sure yet.
Yeah, I gotta pick my moment.
It's kind of a big deal.
Ooh. Thanks.
You know, there's a lot that's changed since you were here.
So Dan says.
But you guys have always been close. You'll figure it out.
-Wish me luck? -Me too.
-Where are you going anyway? -Just some party.
With a friend?
I wouldn't exactly call her that.
See you.
-Hello. -Hey, where are you?
-At your house. -Oh, you're early.
Yeah, I just couldn't wait.
I tried to get you before you left. I feel terrible.
Because I'm early?
No, because, um, I....  I totally spaced(-out).
---------------------------------------
I have this American History paper due Monday.
So, you know, I'll be writing all night.
I'll make it up to you, though, I promise.
Pirogis at Veselka?
I'll call you tomorrow.
Jenny, hey.
Hey.
Jenny, what's wrong?

-And how is this a favor to me again? -Rufus, look around.
When was the last time you had access to the top people in music and art?
Introduce yourself, revitalize your career.
Put that sad little gallery on the cultural radar.
Since when are you the saint of former rock stars?
Since when were you a star?
Leave if you want to, really.
Alison would have a fit if she knew you were accompanying me to this party.
Even if it was for your benefit.
Actually, I don't care what Alison thinks right now.
Good. Then let me introduce you to our hostess.
Eleanor, it is divine. Squint and it's Marrakesh.
Oh, Lily, I had no idea you were bringing a date. How delightful.
-Oh, it's not a date. -This is Rufus Humphrey.
-Pleasure. -It's not a date.
-Look, appetizers, is that couscous? -Yes, please.
---------------------------------------
BART: Hey. ELEANOR: Bart.
-And friend. -Hi.
-Something catch your eye? -Oh, I like her outfit.
-Lily. -Bart.
-Hello. -Hi.
I'd like you to meet Karissa.
-Yeah, hi, Karissa. -Hi.
-Hi, Rufus. -Hi, Rufus.
Hi.
Well, so good to see you.
Great to see you.
-Enjoy. -You too.
Good night.
You and Bart Bass? Suddenly, it all makes sense.
-Brought me to make him jealous. -Don't be ridiculous.
I mean, it's flattering, I guess, but couldn't you have done a little better?
Not on such short notice.
Eleanor, salaam alaikum.
How are you? This is fantastic.
-Beautiful. -God bless you.

So this Blair girl used you as her slave.
No, I was her handmaiden. "Handmaiden" is Jane Austen for "slave."
She never said I'd get to go to the ball if I did all those errands.
Uh-uh. Don't make excuses for her. You did all that stuff, you deserve to go.
---------------------------------------
-You said masked balls were pretentious. -One woman's opinion.
But if you wanna go, no Blair should keep you away.
It's not just Blair. I don't have a gown.
My friend works in the costume department at BAM. We can borrow one. Next?
-I don't have an invitation. -Every ballroom has a back door.  What else?
If Blair saw me, she'd be furious.
Then it's a good thing you'll be wearing a mask.

On the Upper East Side, appearances are often deceiving.
From friends to hair color, there's always more than meets the eye.
Is uptown this way or that way?
It's that way.
These things whizzing by, they're cars. You might wanna avoid them.
You know what? You'll see better without this too.
Oh, that is better.
-Hey, you got a name? -Jack Altman.
Jack Altman. I just stepped out for some air.
Altman? Okay.
Thank you.
Wait, let me see.
Okay, I know you're completely morally opposed to society events and stuff, but--
We'll deprogram you later. This is ugly.
-Just go. -Okay, thanks.
---------------------------------------
VANESSA: Thank you so much.
What was it we said about appearances?
Yes, they can be deceiving.
But most of the time, what you see is what you get.
Hey, have you seen that girl I was with?
When I grabbed her bag, I got her house keys too.
What is Nate doing? He's supposed to go find Kati and 
Is.
-It's getting late, I'm losing heat. -You look ravishing.
If I were your man, I wouldn't need clues to find you.
-Or to ravish me, I'm sure. -Who is that?
BLAIR: Probably some bitch from Chapin. -A hot bitch 
from Chapin.
Forget her, go get Nate, point him in the right direction.
First things first.
Well, hello, angel.
You must be my lucky night.
And with taste to boot.
Apparently, not. I'm talking to you.
Beautiful and mean. I've got chills. Care to dance with a 
poor devil?
Why don't we just skip all that and go somewhere quiet 
to talk?
I'll get the champagne.
Find me in five.
Taking a company public is an enormous responsibility.
Nothing more valuable than a good first impression. You 
taught me that.
Captain, you know that I adore you, but you've never 
---------------------------------------
done fashion before.
I've been talking to Calvin's people, and I have to say...
...the presentation is impressive.
Enough business talk. You're boring her.
Eleanor, I've been thinking when Nate and Blair get 
engaged...
...she should have my great grandmother's ring.
The one that Cornelius Vanderbilt gave her. Huh.
RUFUS: Still spying on him? -I'm not spying.
I'm just keeping track of his whereabouts. So long as 
you're watching, he's winning.
You wanna make a man jealous, there's one thing to do.
I invited you here for many reasons, but knowledge of 
romance is not--
That was unexpected.
Give him 20 minutes.
-I need a drink. -I need a drink.
So every time we see their yacht now...
...we just pull out our air horns and let them rip.
Tell you, it is almost enough to make you never wanna 
summer in Newport again.
Wow, that sounds awful.
It is, it's pretty bad.
Yeah, you know, if you'll excuse me, I think I'm gonna 
go--
To change partners?
-Hey. -Dan, what are you doing here?
-Saving you. -I don't need to be saved.
Really? Because I could see your eyes rolling from 
---------------------------------------
across the room.
Dan.
-Hey. -Blair sent us over.
It's late, you're taking too long.
Your lady-in-waiting's closer than you think. Her 
headdress is feathers of black and pink.
-It's her. -It's me.
What? I'm sorry.
Just find Serena, she'll lead you to Blair.
Serena, right.
Let's play a game. I'd say strip poker, but I don't have 
cards.
How about hide-and-seek?
You hide, I'll seek.
And how will you find me? I don't have any breadcrumbs.
Well....
You can leave me a trail of your clothes.
I have truly died and gone to heaven.
So how are you doing?
Serena, hey.
-What are you doing here? -What am I doing?
I ran across the city, I rented a tuxedo.
I stole this mask from some drunken kid only to look like 
Robin.
I conned my way in here, all to see you.
I care.
You didn't seem to care when you were with another girl 
and lied about it.
---------------------------------------
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. I didn't--
Well, I did.
-Yeah. -I did, but I can explain that.
Go ahead. Give it your best shot.
I was with my friend, Vanessa.
We're very close, and she moved away to Vermont last 
year, now she's back.
Okay, so why did you lie and say it was Jenny?
Because I'm an idiot. I don't know why.
Look, Vanessa and I....
Our relationship is a little complicated.
Or it was, before I met you.
And honestly, I didn't want anything to get in the way of 
you inviting me...
...to this stupid party.
Well, I was gonna invite you.
Really?
So not into Pompous Ass IV?
Are you saying you're not into old friend Vanessa?
That is exactly what I'm saying.
Oh, yes, the other part we love about a masquerade?
When the mask finally comes off, and the truth is 
revealed to all.
Will you excuse me? I just saw the last person I expected 
to see.
-Yeah, how can you say no to that? -I'm sorry.
Vanessa, Vanessa. Hey, this is a surprise.
-Funny, I could say the same thing. -What are you doing 
here?
---------------------------------------
Writing an American History paper. Wait, that was 
supposed to be you.
-When do we start lying to each other? -I merely 
refrained from sharing the truth.
Which sounded more like a lie than what I told you.
-Humphrey. -I didn't understand that either, I admit.
But what was I going to say?
That I was renting a tuxedo to attend a masked ball...
...without a mask or an invitation to go get a girl...
...who not only has a mask and an invitation, but another 
date?
At least it's honest.
-You hate this world. -So do you.
-Or so I thought. -All right, what's going on here 
exactly?
Did you follow me here to prove that I was lying?
Yes, Dan. That's why I'm here.
I stalked you, because I am so obsessed with you. Wait, 
don't stop there.
You're the reason I came back, because I just couldn't 
stop thinking about you.
-I get the point, lay off the sarcasm. -How about I lay 
off the whole evening?
-Bye. -Wait, wait, wait, stop.
Look, listen, I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry that I lied about writing a-- -You said you 
love me.
Loved you in the past.
And in a pre-shaving, 16-year-old kind of way.
You know, I mean, things have changed.
---------------------------------------
VANESSA: Clearly.
Looks like someone's traded up.
So that's....
Vanessa, yeah, she's....
Beautiful.
I have to go out there. I'm sorry.
Feel free to find me.
-I found your pants. -Well, you're getting warmer.
Which is an achievement, considering you're already hot.
Well, you better hope it doesn't get cold.
What is that supposed to mean?
Hey, what the hell? Hey, my phone is in my pants.
Hey, I'm stuck up here, bitch.
DAN: Vanessa.
Vanessa, wait, please.
Why won't you wait?
Oh, because you're not Vanessa, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, case of mistaken identity.
Ironically, not involving masks.
WOMAN: Right.
Lily, there you are.
I just needed a moment, that--
-What just happened. -The kiss?
-Yeah, it made me feel-- -Nostalgic?
-Nauseous. -Right. Um, ouch.
No, I'm kidding.
---------------------------------------
Kind of.
I'm sorry, Rufus. Maybe I shouldn't have asked you here.
Right.
And I'm sorry I kissed you.
But I did it because that mercenary in the starched white 
shirt...
...he doesn't appreciate everything you have... ...over an 
attractive 25-year-old mannequin...
...because beauty fades, though yours has done a 
remarkable job of holding on.
And in the long run, it's gonna be his loss.
And I thought he should know how it feels to lose you.
Because, trust me, it's not fun.
I think it worked.
Lily, may I speak with you for a moment?
If you'll excuse us.
Happy to help.
SERENA: Jenny?
-Hey. -Serena.
-Um, look, you didn't see me here, okay? -Yeah, don't 
worry about it.
Just one in a series of things I'll pretend didn't happen 
tonight.
-Is everything okay? -I'm not sure.
-Dan surprised me by showing up here. -Well, go, Dan.
Yeah, except he threw me for a loop by chasing after 
some girl named Vanessa.
No, V's Dan's best friend.
Yeah, well, they seemed like a little more than that.
---------------------------------------
They've kind of got a history, don't they?
Sure.
But, I mean, Dan's never liked a girl like he likes you.
Really, I mean, come on. He's at a masked ball.
And I think he'd go basically anywhere with you.
Except for the Ice Capades, because that really freaked 
him out when he was 5.
You know what? I--
I think I'll go and try to find him.
Don't know how I'm gonna find anyone. Stupid mask 
keeps falling over my eyes.
Well, I'd give you mine, but masks come off at 
midnight...
...and I kind of need my disguise to get out of here.
Well, you know what? You wanna trade?
-Sure. -Thanks.
And here, take this. It's so hot in here, and you'll 
probably be cold outside.
Here you go.
Hey, did you have fun tonight?
It was everything I hoped.
Good.
-Okay, let's see. -Here.
-Oh, thanks. -Pretty.
Serena, just don't say anything and let me explain.
Oh, my God.
I'm trying to do the right thing, it's killing me.
We both care about Blair, but maybe the best thing is to 
tell her the truth.
---------------------------------------
I'm not over you. And I thought I could fight it, but I can't.
And if you don't stop me, I'm gonna kiss you.
SERENA: Nate?
Nate, what are you doing? You have to find Blair.
Whatever, just forget the clues.
She's wearing big tall boots and a big old crown. Just 
go, okay?
Hurry.
Serena, have you seen Nate? Hey.
PEOPLE: Five, four, three, two, one. -Jenny.
-It's midnight. -Masks off.
Serena.
Serena. Serena, wait.
I'm so sorry. Serena.
Little Jenny Humphrey manages to get my pants off and 
have me not enjoy it.
Quite the accomplishment.
Good thing someone was as lecherous as you or you'd 
still be up on that roof.
And, no, I don't wanna know what you had to do to get 
that tux.
This is me.
All right, Chuck, I'll see you in the a.m.
No, you didn't find me by midnight. No happily ever after 
for you.
Blair, I'm sorry.
All I wanted was for us to start over.
And you didn't even try.
CHUCK: Well, at least somebody's having a good night.
---------------------------------------
SERENA: Hello? -Serena, hey.
Will you please just talk to me, please?
Why did you run away from me?
What are you talking about? You're the one that ran 
away.
I don't think so.
Blonde hair, yellow dress, black furry thing. There's only 
one Serena van der Woodsen.
SERENA: Yeah, no, not tonight.
Let me say, for the record, I like you.
Only you.
Well, that's good, because I feel the same about you.
Glad that's cleared up.
Hey, um, you know, I hear the Ice Capades are coming 
to town.
If you're there, so am I.
Hey.
You guys are up late.
We were celebrating.
Eleanor Waldorf has agreed to let your father's firm...
...take her company public.
Congrats, that's great news.
It is, which is why I was looking for a wine opener.
So I could surprise your father with Margaux. Which is 
how I found this.
Well?
What do you have to say for yourself, Nate?
-What? -Well, it isn't mine.
---------------------------------------
And it isn't your father's.
So that only leaves one other person in this house.
Hey, you're still up.
-Yeah, I'm not that tired. -Oh, I am, I'm exhausted.
I ended up going to that ball actually.
-Oh, really? -Yeah.
Well, your night's not over.
There's someone here to see you.
Pirogis? I come in peace.
Great, because I'm starving.
-Look-- -Save it, Humphrey.
You've never done contrite well.
Besides, I'm the one who should apologize.
No, really, I am. I should've told you about Serena.
-I should've asked you. -I shouldn't have lied about 
tonight.
And I shouldn't have run out on you.
Look, if we're gonna be friends again, we're gonna have 
to figure this stuff out.
You're right.
And I've missed having a friend.
I've missed being one.
We can start slow, with the basics.
Like fewer lies, more Ukrainian food?
And you telling me about everything I missed while I was 
gone?
Such as Serena.
Well, she's pretty fantastic, almost as good as this 
---------------------------------------
pirogi.
Yeah, she's got this crazy mother who's always sparring 
with me.
And this best friend who's very hard for me to deal with.
The best friend's boyfriend is the hardest to deal with.
It's all very complicated. It's very complicated.
